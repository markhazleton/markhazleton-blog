# Bing Webmaster Tools SEO Issues - Resolution Summary

**Date**: January 31, 2025  
**Session**: Copilot Session 2025-01-31  
**Status**: âœ… MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED - Ready for Deployment

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Multiple H1 Tags (5 pages affected)

- **Root Cause**: `src/pug/modules/article-mixins.pug` contained two different mixins both generating `<h1>` tags
- **Solution**: Changed `articleHeader` mixin from `h1` to `h2`, kept `articleHero` as primary `h1`
- **Validation**: 0 files now have multiple h1 tags (down from 1 detected)

### 2. Broken Canonical URLs (4 pages affected)

- **Known Issues**: 2 of 4 pages identified with URL mismatches
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Added redirect: `exploratory-data-analysis-python.html` â†’ `exploratory-data-analysis-eda-using-python.html`
  - Added redirect: `from-readme-to-reality.html` â†’ `from-readme-to-reality-elevating-web-projects.html`
- **Status**: 2 resolved, 2 pending (need specific URLs from Bing)
