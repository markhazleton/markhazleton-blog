# Copilot Generated Documentation

This directory contains all documentation, reports, and analysis files generated by GitHub Copilot during development sessions.

## Directory Structure

```text
copilot/
├── session-YYYY-MM-DD/        # Session-specific generated content
│   ├── *.md                   # Reports, analysis, documentation
│   └── assets/                # Supporting files (if any)
└── README.md                  # This file
```

## Naming Convention

All Copilot-generated markdown files should follow this pattern:

- **Directory**: `/copilot/session-YYYY-MM-DD/`
- **Files**: `DESCRIPTIVE_NAME.md`
- **Date**: The date when the analysis/session was performed

## Examples

- `/copilot/session-2025-08-31/BUILD_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`
- `/copilot/session-2025-08-31/DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS.md`
- `/copilot/session-2025-09-01/PERFORMANCE_REVIEW.md`
- `/copilot/session-2025-09-01/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`

## Purpose

This organization helps:

1. **Keep generated content separate** from core project documentation
2. **Track when analysis was performed** for historical context
3. **Organize by development sessions** for easier reference
4. **Maintain clean root directory** without cluttering with reports
5. **Enable easy cleanup** of outdated analysis files

## Guidelines

- **All Copilot-generated .md files** should go in session directories
- **Use descriptive filenames** that clearly indicate the content
- **Date directories** should match when the work was actually performed
- **Archive old sessions** periodically to keep the directory manageable
- **Reference these files** from main documentation when relevant

## Current Sessions

- `session-2025-08-31/` - Build system optimization and package cleanup analysis
