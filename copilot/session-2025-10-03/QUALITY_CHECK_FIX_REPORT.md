## Issues Identified

### üî¥ Critical Issue #2: Truncated/Corrupted Opening Paragraph

```pug
p.lead.mb-5.
  After exploring              our planning hadn't accounted for.
```

**Impact:**

- Incomplete sentence that made no sense
- Poor user experience
- Appeared unprofessional

**Fix Applied:** Replaced with proper content:

```pug
p.lead.mb-5.
  After discovering how invisible AI contributions vanish in traditional metrics, I encountered
  another measurement trap: using Git history to evaluate team performance.
  The promise of objective data led me down a path of misleading conclusions
  until I discovered what Git analytics actually reveal‚Äîand what they dangerously obscure.
```

### üî¥ Critical Issue #3: Malformed Text Fragment

**Problem:** Line 127 had merged text fragments:

```pug
// Honest reporting with clear limitationsributions vanish in traditional metrics
```
