### 4. Optimize Title Tags in build.js (30 minutes)

**Update build.js template function**:

```javascript
// Current (needs improvement)
<title>${title} | ${config.siteTitle}</title>

// Updated (better for SEO)
function getOptimizedTitle(meta, isHomepage) {
  if (isHomepage) {
    return `${config.siteTitle}: Master the Art & Science of Project Management | ${config.author}`;
  }

  // For subpages
  const baseTitle = meta.title || 'Project Mechanics';
  return `${baseTitle} | ${config.siteTitle}`;
}

// Then in template:
<title>${getOptimizedTitle(meta, file === 'index.md')}</title>
```

---

### 5. Add Google Analytics (15 minutes)

**Update build.js template** to include in `<head>`:

```javascript
// Add to template function
${meta.analytics !== false ? `
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
` : ''}
```

**Action**: Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Google Analytics 4 tracking ID.
