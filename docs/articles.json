I wanted a workspace where I could write modern JavaScript, manage dependencies effortlessly, lint my code, and run a local server with instant updates.\\n\\nHowever, what I didn’t account for was the series of breaking changes in the core packages that made my initial environment incompatible with the newer versions of these tools.\\n\\n## Facing the Initial Issues and Breaking Changes\\n\\nThe first sign of trouble was when I tried to upgrade my core packages—Node.js, Nodemon, and ESLint. Each package had introduced breaking changes that resulted in errors, version conflicts, and even the inability to run the project. The breaking changes in ESLint were the most frustrating. Several rules were deprecated, and new rule configurations required major changes to the `.eslintrc` file. Additionally, the plugin `eslint-plugin-import` began requiring newer versions of ESLint that weren’t backward compatible with my original configuration.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install eslint@latest eslint-plugin-import@latest\\n```\\n\\nNodemon also underwent significant updates. The move to Nodemon 3.x came with breaking changes in how the watcher worked and how it interacted with my build scripts. The config settings I was using to handle auto-reloading became obsolete, causing the server to crash when certain files changed.\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"dev\\\": \\\"nodemon --watch src --exec node server.js\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThese breaking changes led to a cascade of dependency issues, where some packages required older versions of Node.js, while others demanded the latest version. This mismatch made it nearly impossible to have a stable, functioning environment without sacrificing modern features.\\n\\n## Code Changes to Support New Versions\\n\\nTo resolve these issues, I had to update several parts of my codebase. First, I upgraded the project dependencies to the latest versions and updated the ESLint rules and configuration accordingly. For example, ESLint’s newer rules required specific configuration changes. The deprecation of `no-use-before-define` for functions required me to manually rewrite functions or disable the rule in the config file.\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"rules\\\": {\\n  \\\"no-use-before-define\\\": [\\\"error\\\", { \\\"functions\\\": false }]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI also had to refactor my scripts to ensure compatibility with Nodemon’s changes. The way the file watcher worked had changed, so I modified my script in `package.json` to explicitly specify which directories to watch.\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n  \\\"start\\\": \\\"node server.js\\\",\\n  \\\"dev\\\": \\\"nodemon --watch 'src/**/*.js' --exec 'node server.js'\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Troubleshooting Dependency Conflicts\\n\\nThe dependency conflicts were another major issue. Older versions of some libraries, such as Babel or TypeScript, wouldn’t work properly with the newer versions of Node.js or ESLint. I had to experiment with different version combinations to find a setup that worked without too many compatibility issues. The conflicts between Node.js versions and specific package versions required that I settle on using Node.js 16.x, which was a stable release compatible with both ESLint and Nodemon. However, this still meant that I couldn’t use certain cutting-edge features of Node.js 18.x without risking breaking the entire setup.\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"engines\\\": {\\n  \\\"node\\\": \\\">=16.0.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo handle these issues, I relied on tools like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to switch between Node.js versions easily, allowing me to maintain different projects with different Node.js versions without causing issues in my overall environment.\\n\\n```bash\\nnvm use 16\\n```\\n\\n## The Decision to Start Over\\n\\nAfter countless hours spent troubleshooting, upgrading dependencies, and trying different combinations, I realized that my dev environment was a patchwork of fixes that lacked stability. I made the tough decision to scrap the original environment and start fresh with a minimalist setup that only included the essentials. This decision was key in reducing complexity and avoiding further dependency conflicts. I chose to start with the basics: a simple server, a linter, and a few essential packages. Once that was stable, I could expand incrementally.\\n\\n## Lessons Learned from Breaking Changes\\n\\nThe experience of troubleshooting breaking changes taught me valuable lessons about maintaining a development environment:\\n\\n1. **Stick to LTS Versions**: Always aim for Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Node.js and other core packages to avoid running into cutting-edge changes that could break backward compatibility.\\n2. **Understand Your Dependencies**: Before upgrading any package, especially major versions, review the changelogs and release notes to understand what breaking changes have been introduced.\\n3. **Use Version Locking**: Using `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` files can save a lot of trouble by ensuring consistent dependency versions across different environments.\\n4. **Refactor Incrementally**: When upgrading or fixing breaking changes, it’s better to refactor your codebase step-by-step, rather than trying to overhaul everything at once.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Starting Fresh After Breaking Changes\\n\\nThe breaking changes to Node.js, ESLint, and Nodemon forced me to re-evaluate my initial approach. By starting fresh and focusing on core functionality, I was able to create a more stable and maintainable development environment. This experience reinforced the importance of simplicity and version management in modern development workflows.\\n\\n## Rebuilding My JS-Dev-Env Project\\n\\nWhen I first set out to build a development environment for my JavaScript project, I envisioned a smooth, streamlined setup that would support all my needs. I wanted a workspace where I could write modern JavaScript, manage dependencies effortlessly, lint my code, and run a local server with instant updates.\\n\\nBut things didn't go as planned. Here is how I built a functional dev environment from scratch.\\n\\n### Building a Basic Development Environment\\n\\nI started fresh, deleting everything in my folder except for `.git` and starting over. At least I would have a history of before and after.\\n\\n```bash\\ncd js-dev-env\\nnpm init -y\\n```\\n\\nI installed core packages like Express, Nodemon, EJS, and Bootstrap.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install express nodemon ejs bootstrap\\nnpm install --save-dev nodemon\\n```\\n\\nI then added basic scripts to `package.json`.\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n  \\\"start\\\": \\\"node server.js\\\",\\n  \\\"dev\\\": \\\"nodemon server.js\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Building the Basic Site\\n\\nI set up a simple Express server to serve content and EJS templates.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require('express');\\nconst path = require('path');\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.set('view engine', 'ejs');\\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));\\n\\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\\n  res.render('index', { title: 'Home' });\\n});\\n\\napp.listen(3000, () => {\\n  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Running the Site\\n\\nWith everything set up, I used Nodemon to run the development server.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run dev\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion: Lessons Learned\\n\\nIn the end, starting over helped me streamline my development environment. By going back to basics, I was able to:\\n\\n- Use Express to serve static content and manage routes.\\n- Integrate Nodemon to automatically restart the server on changes during development.\\n- Employ EJS to easily manage templates and layouts.\\n- Utilize Bootstrap to simplify styling without writing custom CSS.\\n\\nThis approach not only simplified my development process but taught me the value of focusing on core functionality first.\\n\\n## Dynamic Content and Navigation\\n\\n### Simplify Content Management and Navigation Using a JSON File\\n\\nI decided I wanted some dynamic content and navigation in the project. I added a `pages.json` file to dynamically control both the content and navigation of the pages in my JS-Dev-Env project. This approach allows you to manage your site's content and navigation links without hardcoding them, making it much easier to update or add new pages later on.\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\nBefore starting, ensure the following is in place:\\n\\n- Node.js installed\\n- Express set up to handle routes\\n- EJS templating engine\\n- Bootstrap for styling\\n\\n#### Step 1: Create the `pages.json` File\\n\\nThe `pages.json` file will hold details for all your site's pages, such as the title, URL, template, and content. This will allow you to dynamically generate both pages and navigation. First, create a `data` folder in the root of your project, and inside it, create a `pages.json` file. Here's an example of how to structure your JSON file:\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"Home\\\",\\n    \\\"url\\\": \\\"/\\\",\\n    \\\"template\\\": \\\"page\\\",\\n    \\\"content\\\": {\\n      \\\"heading\\\": \\\"Welcome to My Bootstrap 5 Website\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"This is the home page.\\\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"About\\\",\\n    \\\"url\\\": \\\"/about\\\",\\n    \\\"template\\\": \\\"page\\\",\\n    \\\"content\\\": {\\n      \\\"heading\\\": \\\"About Us\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"This is the about page. Learn more about us here.\\\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"Contact\\\",\\n    \\\"url\\\": \\\"/contact\\\",\\n    \\\"template\\\": \\\"page\\\",\\n    \\\"content\\\": {\\n      \\\"heading\\\": \\\"Contact Us\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"Get in touch with us using the form below.\\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n#### Step 2: Modify `index.js` to Use `pages.json`\\n\\nNow, update your `index.js` file to read the `pages.json` data and generate routes dynamically. This step also involves extracting the top-level pages for the navigation bar and passing them to EJS templates.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require('express');\\nconst path = require('path');\\nconst fs = require('fs');\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.set('view engine', 'ejs');\\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));\\n\\n// Read the pages.json file\\nconst pagesData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'data', 'pages.json'), 'utf-8'));\\n\\n// Filter top-level pages for navigation\\nconst topLevelPages = pagesData.filter(page => (page.url.match(/\\\\//g) || []).length === 1);\\n\\n// Generate dynamic routes from pages.json\\npagesData.forEach(page => {\\n  app.get(page.url, (req, res) => {\\n    res.render(page.template, {\\n      title: page.title,\\n      heading: page.content.heading,\\n      text: page.content.text,\\n      pages: topLevelPages  // Pass navigation items\\n    });\\n  });\\n});\\n\\n// Start the server\\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\\napp.listen(port, () => {\\n  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n#### Step 3: Update the Layout to Include Dynamic Navigation\\n\\nNext, update the `layout.ejs` file to dynamically render the navigation bar based on the `pages.json` data. This avoids hardcoding navigation links in every template and makes it easier to manage as new pages are added.\\n\\n```html\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n<head>\\n  <meta charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\">\\n  <meta name=\\\"viewport\\\" content=\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\">\\n  <title><%= title %></title>\\n  <link href=\\\"/css/modern-styles.css\\\" rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\">\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n  <!-- Dynamic Navigation Bar -->\\n  <nav class=\\\"navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"container-fluid\\\">\\n      <a class=\\\"navbar-brand\\\" href=\\\"/\\\">My Site</a>\\n      <button class=\\\"navbar-toggler\\\" type=\\\"button\\\" data-bs-toggle=\\\"collapse\\\" data-bs-target=\\\"#navbarNav\\\" aria-controls=\\\"navbarNav\\\" aria-expanded=\\\"false\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"navbar-toggler-icon\\\"></span>\\n      </button>\\n      <div class=\\\"collapse navbar-collapse\\\" id=\\\"navbarNav\\\">\\n        <ul class=\\\"navbar-nav ms-auto\\\">\\n          <% pages.forEach(function(page) { %>\\n            <li class=\\\"nav-item\\\">\\n              <a class=\\\"nav-link\\\" href=\\\"<%= page.url %>\\\"><%= page.title %></a>\\n            </li>\\n          <% }); %>\\n        </ul>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </nav>\\n  <!-- Main Content -->\\n  <main class=\\\"container mt-5\\\">\\n    <h1><%= heading %></h1>\\n    <p><%= text %></p>\\n    <%- body %> <!-- View content will be injected here -->\\n  </main>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\n#### Step 4: Create EJS Templates for Each Page\\n\\nEach page in the `pages.json` file needs a corresponding EJS template. I started out with a very basic `page",

By simplifying the integration, the chat completions implementation becomes more efficient and effective, embracing a continuous learning approach. This transition underscores the importance of staying open to better, streamlined methods as new insights emerge, allowing us to build more responsive, user-centric applications.\\n\\n## Building an AI-driven, Real-time Chat\\n\\nThis guide covers the steps to create an interactive chat experience using ASP.NET SignalR for real-time functionality and OpenAI's GPT models for intelligent responses, through Semantic Kernel. The goal is to simplify and enhance the process of embedding chat completions, making the design more efficient and ready for a VIT React Native environment.\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nIn this article, developers and solution architects will learn how to integrate ASP.NET SignalR with Semantic Kernel's chat completion service to build a responsive, intelligent chat application in PromptSpark. SignalR enables real-time communication, while Semantic Kernel leverages OpenAI's GPT models for contextually relevant responses.\\n\\n### What You’ll Build and Why It Matters\\n\\nYou’ll create an interactive chat application where users receive immediate, AI-generated responses, closely simulating natural conversation flow. Combining SignalR's real-time messaging and Semantic Kernel's adaptive AI enhances engagement, suitable for use cases like customer support, virtual assistants, and interactive content.\\n\\n### Setting Up Your Development Environment\\n\\nThis project requires ASP.NET Core, SignalR, and Semantic Kernel. Follow these steps to set up your environment and secure your OpenAI API keys with environment variables.\\n\\n```bash\\ndotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR\\ndotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel\\n```\\n\\n### Setting Up Program.cs\\n\\nIn this section, we’ll set up the main program configuration in `Program.cs` for the integration of SignalR and OpenAI’s GPT models via Semantic Kernel. This configuration ensures real-time functionality and prepares the AI chat service for prompt responses.\\n\\n#### Logging Configuration\\n\\nAdd console logging for debugging and set a debug level to capture detailed information.\\n\\n```csharp\\nbuilder.Logging.AddConsole();\\nbuilder.Logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);\\n```\\n\\n#### SignalR Setup\\n\\nAdd SignalR to the services, enabling real-time messaging capabilities in the application.\\n\\n```csharp\\nbuilder.Services.AddSignalR();\\n```\\n\\n#### OpenAI API Integration\\n\\nConfigure Semantic Kernel’s `AddOpenAIChatCompletion` service, using API keys stored in environment variables. Ensure the environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `MODEL_ID` are correctly set to avoid errors.\\n\\n```csharp\\nstring apikey = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>(\\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\\") ?? \\\"not found\\\";\\nstring modelId = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>(\\\"MODEL_ID\\\") ?? \\\"gpt-4o\\\";\\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenAIChatCompletion(modelId, apikey);\\n```\\n\\n#### Routing and Middleware\\n\\nMap routes for API controllers and the SignalR `ChatHub`, enabling endpoint access and serving static files like the front-end HTML.\\n\\n```csharp\\nvar app = builder.Build();\\napp.UseDefaultFiles();  // Looks for index.html, index.htm by default\\napp.UseStaticFiles();\\n\\napp.MapControllers();\\napp.MapHub<ChatHub>(\\\"/chatHub\\\");\\n```\\n\\n### Implementing the SignalR Chat Hub\\n\\nThe ChatHub manages messages, maintains conversation history, and processes real-time user interactions. Below is the implementation of the `ChatHub` class, which initializes with an instance of `IChatCompletionService` and manages message flow with a `ConcurrentDictionary` for chat history.\\n\\n```csharp\\npublic class ChatHub(IChatCompletionService _chatCompletionService) : Hub\\n{\\n  public class ChatEntry\\n  {\\n    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }\\n    public string User { get; set; }\\n    public string UserMessage { get; set; }\\n    public string BotResponse { get; set; }\\n  }\\n\\n  private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, List<ChatEntry>> ChatHistoryCache = new();\\n\\n  public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message, string conversationId)\\n  {\\n    if (!ChatHistoryCache.ContainsKey(conversationId))\\n    {\\n      ChatHistoryCache[conversationId] = new List<ChatEntry>();\\n    }\\n    var timestamp = DateTime.Now;\\n\\n    // Broadcast user's message\\n    await Clients.All.SendAsync(\\\"ReceiveMessage\\\", user, message, conversationId);\\n\\n    var chatHistory = new ChatHistory();\\n    chatHistory.AddSystemMessage(\\\"You are in a conversation, keep your answers brief, always ask follow-up questions, ask if ready for full answer.\\\");\\n\\n    foreach (var chatEntry in ChatHistoryCache[conversationId])\\n    {\\n      chatHistory.AddUserMessage(chatEntry.UserMessage);\\n      chatHistory.AddSystemMessage(chatEntry.BotResponse);\\n    }\\n    chatHistory.AddUserMessage(message);\\n\\n    // Generate bot response with streaming\\n    var botResponse = await GenerateStreamingBotResponse(chatHistory, conversationId);\\n\\n    // Add the message to the in-memory cache\\n    ChatHistoryCache[conversationId].Add(new ChatEntry\\n    {\\n      Timestamp = timestamp,\\n      User = user,\\n      UserMessage = message,\\n      BotResponse = botResponse\\n    });\\n  }\\n\\n  private async Task<string> GenerateStreamingBotResponse(ChatHistory chatHistory, string conversationId)\\n  {\\n    var buffer = new StringBuilder();\\n    var message = new StringBuilder();\\n    try\\n    {\\n      await foreach (var response in _chatCompletionService.GetStreamingChatMessageContentsAsync(chatHistory))\\n      {\\n        if (response?.Content != null)\\n        {\\n          buffer.Append(response.Content);\\n\\n          if (response.Content.Contains('\\\\n'))\\n          {\\n            var contentToSend = buffer.ToString();\\n            await Clients.All.SendAsync(\\\"ReceiveMessage\\\", \\\"ChatBot\\\", contentToSend, conversationId);\\n            await AppendToCsvLog(conversationId, \\\"System\\\", contentToSend);\\n            message.Append(contentToSend);\\n            buffer.Clear();\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }\\n\\n      if (buffer.Length > 0)\\n      {\\n        var remainingContent = buffer.ToString();\\n        await Clients.All.SendAsync(\\\"ReceiveMessage\\\", \\\"ChatBot\\\", remainingContent, conversationId);\\n        message.Append(remainingContent);\\n        await AppendToCsvLog(conversationId, \\\"System\\\", remainingContent);\\n      }\\n    }\\n    catch (Exception ex)\\n    {\\n      Console.WriteLine($\\\"Error in generating bot response: {ex.Message}\\\");\\n      message.Append(\\\"An error occurred while processing your request.\\\");\\n      await Clients.Caller.SendAsync(\\\"ReceiveMessage\\\", \\\"System\\\", \\\"An error occurred while processing your request.\\\");\\n    }\\n    return message.ToString();\\n  }\\n\\n  private async Task AppendToCsvLog(string conversationId, string sender, string message)\\n  {\\n    Console.WriteLine($\\\"{DateTime.Now}, {conversationId}, {sender}: {message}\\\");\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Generating AI-Powered Responses with Semantic Kernel\\n\\nThe `GenerateStreamingBotResponse` method in the ChatHub class generates responses asynchronously. This method streams responses to the client in real-time, providing a continuous \\\"typing\\\" effect for a more dynamic chat experience.\\n\\n### Building the Front-End for PromptSpark Chat\\n\\nSet up a user-friendly interface with an input box, chat history window, and “send” button. Establish a SignalR connection for real-time messaging, and use streaming for a “typing” effect in AI responses.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()\\n  .withUrl(\\\"/chathub\\\")\\n  .build();\\n\\nconnection.on(\\\"ReceiveMessage\\\", (user, message, conversationId) => {\\n  // Display received messages\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Front-End Testing with index.html\\n\\nCreate a simple test harness 'index.html' in the wwwroot folder for the interactive chat interface. It provides a basic layout with Bootstrap styling, enabling users to send messages and view responses in real-time.\\n\\n```html\\n<div class=\\\"card\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"card-header text-center\\\">\\n    <h2>PromptSpark Chat</h2>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\\\"card-body\\\">\\n    <div id=\\\"userForm\\\" class=\\\"mb-4\\\">\\n      <label for=\\\"userInput\\\" class=\\\"form-label\\\">Enter your name to join the chat:</label>\\n      <input type=\\\"text\\\" id=\\\"userInput\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" placeholder=\\\"Your name\\\" />\\n      <button class=\\\"btn btn-primary mt-2\\\" onclick=\\\"joinChat()\\\">Join Chat</button>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\\\"chatWindow\\\" style=\\\"display: none;\\\">\\n      <ul id=\\\"messagesList\\\" class=\\\"list-unstyled mb-3 p-3 border rounded bg-white\\\" style=\\\"height: 300px; overflow-y: scroll;\\\">\\n      </ul>\\n      <div class=\\\"input-group\\\">\\n        <input type=\\\"text\\\" id=\\\"messageInput\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" placeholder=\\\"Type your message here...\\\" />\\n        <button class=\\\"btn btn-primary\\\" onclick=\\\"sendMessage()\\\">Send</button>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nAdd the following JavaScript code to the 'index.html' file to establish a SignalR connection and handle real-time messaging.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()\\n  .withUrl(\\\"/chatHub\\\")\\n  .configureLogging(signalR.LogLevel.Information)\\n  .build();\\n\\nlet userName = \\\"\\\";\\nlet conversationId = localStorage.getItem(\\\"conversationId\\\") || generateConversationId();\\nlet botMessageElement = null;\\nlocalStorage.setItem(\\\"conversationId\\\", conversationId);\\n\\nfunction generateConversationId() {\\n  return Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15);\\n}\\n\\nasync function start() {\\n  try {\\n    await connection.start();\\n    console.log(\\\"Connected to SignalR hub!\\\");\\n  } catch (err) {\\n    console.error(\\\"Connection failed: \\\", err);\\n    setTimeout(start, 5000);\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nconnection.on(\\\"ReceiveMessage\\\", (user, message) => {\\n  const messagesList = document.getElementById(\\\"messagesList\\\");\\n\\n  if (user === \\\"ChatBot\\\") {\\n    if (!botMessageElement) {\\n      botMessageElement = document.createElement(\\\"li\\\");\\n      botMessageElement.classList.add(\\\"mb-2\\\");\\n      botMessageElement.setAttribute(\\\"data-user\\\", \\\"ChatBot\\\");\\n      botMessageElement.innerHTML = `<strong>${user}:</strong> <span class=\\\"bot-message-content\\\"></span>`;\\n      messagesList.appendChild(botMessageElement);\\n    }\\n    botMessageElement.querySelector(\\\".bot-message-content\\\").textContent += message + \\\" \\\";\\n  } else {\\n    botMessageElement = null;\\n    const li = document.createElement(\\\"li\\\");\\n    li.classList.add(\\\"mb-2\\\");\\n    li.innerHTML = `<strong>${user}:</strong> ${message}`;\\n    messagesList.appendChild(li);\\n  }\\n  messagesList.scrollTop = messagesList.scrollHeight;\\n});\\n\\nfunction joinChat() {\\n  userName = document.getElementById(\\\"userInput\\\").value.trim();\\n  if (userName) {\\n    document.getElementById(\\\"userForm\\\").style.display = \\\"none\\\";\\n    document.getElementById(\\\"chatWindow\\\").style.display = \\\"block\\\";\\n    document.getElementById(\\\"messageInput\\\").focus();\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nasync function sendMessage() {\\n  const message = document.getElementById(\\\"messageInput\\\").value.trim();\\n  if (userName && message) {\\n    try {\\n      await connection.invoke(\\\"SendMessage\\\", userName, message, conversationId);\\n      document.getElementById(\\\"messageInput\\\").value = '';\\n    } catch (err) {\\n      console.error(\\\"SendMessage failed: \\\", err);\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\ndocument.getElementById(\\\"messageInput\\\").addEventListener(\\\"keypress\\\", function (event) {\\n  if (event.key === \\\"Enter\\\") {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    sendMessage();\\n  }\\n});\\n\\nstart();\\n```\\n\\n#### SignalR Connection\\n\\nEstablishes a real-time connection with the SignalR hub. This is some simple JavaScript code that connects to the SignalR hub and logs a message to the console when the connection is successful.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()\\n  .withUrl(\\\"/chathub\\\")\\n  .build();\\n\\nconnection.on(\\\"ReceiveMessage\\\", (user, message, conversationId) => {\\n  // Display received messages\\n});\\n```\\n\\n#### User Interaction\\n\\nProvides a join functionality with a unique conversation",

They are particularly useful for generating repetitive HTML structures with varying data.\\n\\nOne practical application of PUG mixins in my projects was creating a dynamic Bootstrap carousel to showcase the websites I have built. Using mixins, I was able to define reusable components for the carousel structure and its captions, making it simple to iterate over project data and render the carousel dynamically.\\n\\n#### The Carousel Mixins\\n\\nBelow is the code for the mixins I used. The first mixin, `carousel-caption`, generates the captions for each slide, while the second mixin, `carousel`, creates the overall carousel structure:\\n\\n```pug\\n//- carousel caption\\nmixin carousel-caption(item)\\n  .carousel-caption\\n    unless !item.h1\\n    unless !item.p\\n    unless !item.button\\n  p\\n    a.btn.btn-lg.btn-primary(href=item.button.url role=\\\"button\\\") #{item.button.caption}\\n\\n//- carousel\\nmixin carousel(id, items)\\n  .carousel.slide.carousel-dark(id=\\\"carousel-\\\" + id ,data-bs-ride=\\\"carousel\\\")\\n    //- Indicators\\n    .carousel-indicators\\n      each item, index in items\\n        if(index === 0)\\n          button.active(type=\\\"button\\\", data-bs-target=\\\"#carousel-\\\" + id, data-bs-slide-to=index, aria-current=\\\"true\\\", aria-label=\\\"Slide \\\" + (index + 1))\\n        else\\n          button(type=\\\"button\\\", data-bs-target=\\\"#carousel-\\\" + id, data-bs-slide-to=index, aria-label=\\\"Slide \\\" + (index + 1))\\n  //- Wrapper for slides\\n  .carousel-inner()\\n    each item, index in items\\n      if(index === 0)\\n        .carousel-item.active\\n          .card\\n            .card-header.text-center\\n              a(href=item.h target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" title=item.p)=item.p\\n            .card-body\\n              img.img-fluid(src=item.image title=item.h alt=item.p)\\n              p.text-black=item.d\\n          +carousel-caption(item)\\n      else\\n        .carousel-item\\n          .card\\n            .card-header.text-center\\n              a(href=item.h target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" title=item.p)=item.p\\n            .card-body\\n              img.img-fluid(src=item.image title=item.h alt=item.p)\\n              p.text-black=item.d\\n          +carousel-caption(item)\\n\\n  //- Controls\\n  button.carousel-control-prev(data-bs-target=\\\"#carousel-\\\" + id, data-bs-slide=\\\"prev\\\", type=\\\"button\\\")\\n    span.carousel-control-prev-icon(aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\")\\n    span.visualy-hidden Previous\\n  button.carousel-control-next(data-bs-target=\\\"#carousel-\\\" + id, data-bs-slide=\\\"next\\\", type=\\\"button\\\")\\n    span.carousel-control-next-icon(aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\")\\n    span.visualy-hidden Next\\n```\\n\\n### How the Carousel Showcases Projects\\n\\nThe `carousel` mixin is invoked with the `projects` data array to generate the entire carousel. Each slide displays a project with its image, description, and a link to view the project. The dynamic generation of slides ensures scalability, allowing new projects to be added easily without modifying the carousel structure.\\n\\nHere is how the mixin is used in a card to display the carousel:\\n\\n```pug\\n.card.mb4\\n  .card-header\\n    h2.card-title Website Projects\\n    p.card-text.\\n      These are some of the websites I have built. I have used a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ASP.Net.\\n      I have also used a variety of frameworks including Bootstrap, jQuery, and PUG Templates.\\n  .card-body\\n    +carousel(\\\"Projects\\\", projects)\\n  .card-footer\\n    p\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUsing PUG mixins for creating reusable components like this carousel has significantly streamlined my development workflow. It ensures consistency in design while making it easy to add, modify, or remove projects in the future. Mixins are a cornerstone of efficient PUG development, especially for dynamic, data-driven websites.\",\"keywords\":\"PUG, Node.js, template engine, Mark Hazleton, web development, Express.js, SEO\",\"seoTitle\":\"Getting Started with PUG: A Template Engine | Mark Hazleton\",\"metaDescription\":\"Discover the history, features, and future of PUG, a Node.js template engine.
