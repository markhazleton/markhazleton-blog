                        <dt>Structured Learning</dt>
                        <dd class="m-4">
                            <p>In recent years, online learning has become an increasingly popular option for individuals looking to acquire new skills. With the abundance of resources available online, structured learning has become more accessible and convenient than ever before. Here are some tips for how to do structured learning online:</p>
                            <dl class="row">

Most platforms offer various resources, such as online tutors, discussion forums, and office hours with instructors. Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you're struggling with a concept or need clarification on something.</dd>
                                <dt class="col-sm-3">Apply what you learn</dt>
                                <dd class="col-sm-9">Finally, it's important to apply what you're learning to real-world situations. Look for opportunities to practice and apply the skills you're learning, such as through projects, internships, or volunteer work. This will help you solidify your understanding of the material and make it more relevant to your life and career.</dd>
                            </dl>
                            <p>In conclusion, structured online learning can be a convenient and effective way to acquire new skills and further your education. By choosing a reputable platform, setting clear goals, creating a schedule, engaging with the material, seeking support, and applying what you learn, you can make the most out of your online learning experience.</p>
                            <p>For structured learning, online courses are now more popular than ever. Here are some of my favorite online learning platforms:</p>
                            <dl>
                                <dt>Pluralsight:</dt>
                                <dd>This platform offers a constantly updated list of courses on the latest technologies taught by some of the best online instructors in the industry. The courses come with plenty of hands-on opportunities with exercise files or GitHub repositories. You can choose to watch a course or follow along step-by-step with the coding techniques being demonstrated. Pluralsight allows you to follow and track content creators, making it easier to find an instructor that closely matches your learning style.

                                <dt>Microsoft Learning:</dt>
                                <dd>This platform offers many free online options that include hands-on labs and an integrated development environment. For Azure services, there is tight integration with a sandbox that allows you to create your own Azure services as you learn. You can take courses that prepare you for a Microsoft certification exam or just explore an area that is new to you. Microsoft Learn lets you publish your profile so people can see what you have been learning. However, most of the courses are text and multiple questions with little engaging video content.</dd>
                                <dt>LinkedIn Learning:</dt>
                                <dd>This platform has a vast course collection built from the acquisition of Lynda. You can access it via subscription.</dd>
                            </dl>
                            <p>For on-the-go refreshers, mobile applications like Sololearn are great for quick snippets of topics. You can practice on your phone in your downtime, but data entry on a phone may be a drawback for some.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Passive Learning</dt>
                        <dd class="m-4">
                            <p>When you are on the go and not at your computer, podcasts are great for passive learning. My favorite is .NET Rocks! Each episode discusses the latest trends in technology related to the .Net platform from Microsoft.</p>
                            <p>In today's fast-paced world, finding time to stay current in your profession can be a challenge. Between work obligations, personal commitments, and other responsibilities, it can be challenging to carve out time for ongoing education and training. However, with the rise of passive learning, it's now easier than ever to stay up-to-date while on the go. Passive learning, defined as listening to content related to your profession while you walk or commute, has become increasingly popular in recent years. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of passive learning and provide tips for how to make the most of your listening time.</p>
                            <p>The idea of passive learning is simple: instead of dedicating specific time to studying or training, you can listen to podcasts, audiobooks, or other educational content while doing other activities. Whether you're walking to work, commuting on the train, or running errands, passive learning allows you to make the most of your downtime and stay up-to-date in your profession.</p>
                            <p>One of the biggest benefits of passive learning is that it allows you to stay current and relevant without sacrificing other areas of your life. With passive learning, you can make the most of your commute, exercise routine, or other daily activities, and turn that time into a productive learning experience.</p>
                            <p>Another benefit of passive learning is that it can be more engaging and entertaining than traditional forms of education. Listening to podcasts or audiobooks can be a fun and engaging way to learn, and it allows you to hear from a wide range of experts in your field.</p>
                            <p>To make the most of your passive learning experience, it's essential to choose content that is relevant and engaging. Look for podcasts or audiobooks that cover topics that are relevant to your profession and that provide actionable insights and strategies. You may also want to consider subscribing to multiple sources so that you can get a diverse range of perspectives and insights.</p>
                            <p>Another tip for making the most of your passive learning experience is to set goals for yourself. Whether you want to learn a new skill, expand your knowledge in a particular area, or stay up-to-date on the latest trends, having clear goals can help you stay motivated and focused.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, passive learning can be a powerful tool for staying current and relevant in your profession. By listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and other educational content while you walk or commute, you can turn your downtime into a productive learning experience. With the right approach and mindset, passive learning can help you stay ahead of the curve and achieve your professional goals. So why not start today? Choose some relevant content, set your goals, and turn your daily routine into a transformative learning experience.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Unstructured Learning</dt>
                        <dd class="m-4">
                            <p>For unstructured learning, many great projects are available on GitHub to explain concepts. Many authors publish course files in a GitHub repository that you can clone or download for more experimentation and development beyond the scope of the original course.</p>
                            <p>In today's rapidly changing technological landscape, it is essential to keep up with the latest trends and skills in your field. While structured learning programs and passive learning through podcasts and audiobooks can be helpful, they often lack the hands-on experience necessary to truly master new technologies. Unstructured learning, or the process of exploring and experimenting with new technologies on your own, can be a powerful tool for lifelong learners looking to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
                            <p>One of the best ways to engage in unstructured learning is by exploring GitHub repositories. GitHub is a platform that hosts millions of open-source projects, and it's an excellent resource for finding code that can help you learn new skills. Many developers publish their code on GitHub, and exploring these projects can be a valuable way to experiment with new technologies and see how they work in real-world applications.</p>
                            <p>To get started with unstructured learning, the first step is to find a GitHub repository that interests you. You can search for repositories based on programming language, topic, or even by specific keywords. Once you find a repository you like, the next step is to clone it to your local machine. Cloning a repository creates a local copy of the code that you can experiment with and modify without affecting the original codebase.</p>
                            <p>Once you have the code on your machine, you can start exploring and experimenting with it. Try making small modifications to the code and see how they affect the program's behavior. Use debugging tools to step through the code and see how it works. By experimenting with the code in this way, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how the technology works and how you can use it in your projects.</p>
                            <p>One of the biggest advantages of unstructured learning is the ability to experiment with new technologies in a low-risk environment. When you're working on a personal project or experimenting with code from a GitHub repository, you don't have to worry about breaking anything or causing problems for your team. This can be a liberating feeling and can help you approach new technologies with more confidence and creativity.</p>
                            <p>Of course, unstructured learning does have its challenges. Without a structured curriculum or instructor to guide you, it can be easy to get overwhelmed or lost in the details. That's why it's important to set goals for your unstructured learning and to be disciplined about the time you spend exploring new technologies.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, unstructured learning can be a powerful tool for lifelong learners looking to stay ahead of the curve in their field. By exploring GitHub repositories and experimenting with new technologies on your own, you can gain a deeper understanding of how they work and how you can use them in your projects. While unstructured learning does require discipline and focus, it can also be a fun and rewarding way to explore new technologies and reinvent yourself as a lifelong learner.</p>

The transformative power of lifelong learning is unparalleled, and it can help you reinvent yourself both personally and professionally.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, lifelong learning is a powerful tool that can help you reinvent yourself and achieve your goals.
