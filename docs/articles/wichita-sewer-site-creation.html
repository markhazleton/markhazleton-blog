                                <p>
                                    I want to share a journey that began at a Rotary Club meeting, an encounter that would lead to an exciting project intertwining mixing technology, creativity, and entrepreneurship. It was there I met Jonathan Roper, an entrepreneur from Wichita, Kansas, brimming with ideas and the recent owner of a license for a Sewer and Drain Service company. What Jon lacked, however, was a digital presence for his new venture, a gap I was eager to fill. This is the story of how

                                    came to be, a project born from a chance meeting and driven by a shared vision to build something impactful.
                                </p>
                                <p>The vision was to develop an online space that was not just informative but also engaging and representative of the brand's commitment to quality service. This vision was the catalyst for the creation of the Wichita Sewer and Drain website, from its initial planning and design to its final launch and beyond.</p>

                        <p>My first step was to understand the core of Jonathan's business, its values, and how it wished to be perceived. This knowledge was the guide for every subsequent decision, from the aesthetics of the logo to the functionality of the website.</p>
                        <p>The initial planning set the stage for what was to become a digital presence of Wichita Sewer and Drain Service. It was a period marked by decisions that were both strategic and creative, each step taken with the goal of building a website that not only met our immediate needs but also provided a scalable foundation for the future.</p>

                                <p>The first step was creating the compnay logo. We embarked on a collaborative process, engaging both a talented Fiverr consultant and a local artist known for their creativity. The synergy between their distinct styles and perspectives culminated in a logo that was not just visually appealing but also versatile enough to grace various mediums, from the digital landscape of the website to tangible items like work shirts and promotional products.</p>

                        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                        <p>I quickly relaized how opinionated I was about the tools and technologies I wanted to use. I wanted to use the tools and technologies that I was most comfortable with and that I knew would allow me to move quickly and efficiently.</p>
                        <p>Here are the tools and technologies I chose to use for the Wichita Sewer and Drain website:</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about">Node.js and npm</a></dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>I chose to go with a static website built with Node.js and the npm command line. This choice was influenced by the following factors:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. It provides various APIs for building web sites, handling files, and managing dependencies.</li>
                                    <li>npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js. It allows you to install and manage third-party libraries (packages) easily.</li>
                                    <li>Utilizing JavaScript for site generation simplifies the development process, enabling faster and more cohesive project progress.</li>
                                    <li>Access to npm's extensive library of tools and packages allows for rapid integration of features and automation of tasks, enhancing development efficiency.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html" target="_blank">Pug Template Engine</a></dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>My choice to use the pug template engine was influenced by its simplicity and flexibility, and my experience with it on multipl other sites. I knew that once I had the enviroment setup, I could move quickly to create new pages and content. I also wanted to created a platform that would allow for eacy updated and maintenance.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pug is a high-performance template engine for Node.js and browsers. It’s heavily influenced by Haml and is implemented using JavaScript.</li>
                                    <li>Pug provides a clean, whitespace-sensitive syntax for writing HTML templates. It focuses on performance and powerful features.</li>
                                    <li>You can use Pug to create dynamic HTML content by embedding variables, loops, and conditionals directly in your templates.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code (Microsoft)</a></dt>
                            <dd>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. Known for its versatility, it supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, making it a popular choice among developers worldwide. VS Code stands out for its user-friendly interface, extensive extension marketplace, and robust set of integrated development tools, such as debugging, version control, and task running, which streamline the coding process.</li>
                                    <li>Extensive Language Support: VS Code provides built-in support for a multitude of programming languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more, making it suitable for a wide range of development projects.</li>
                                    <li>Rich Extension Ecosystem: The editor's marketplace offers thousands of extensions, allowing users to customize their development environment to their specific needs, enhancing productivity and efficiency.</li>
                                    <li>Integrated Development Tools: With features like IntelliSense for code completion, built-in Git support, and an integrated terminal, VS Code offers a comprehensive development experience within a single platform.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                            <dt><a href="https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-ui-kit-pro" target="_blank">SB UI Kit Pro (Start Bootstrap)</a></dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>My choice of the SB UI Kit Pro template from StartBootstrap was influenced by its robust features and adaptability. It offered a wealth of design elements and functionalities, all built on the latest web technologies. This template was not just a starting point but a launchpad that allowed us to craft a website that was both aesthetically pleasing and functionally robust, leveraging the power of Bootstrap 5 and the pug template tool.

                        <h2>Development and Deployment</h2>
                        <p>The transition from design to development marked a pivotal phase in the journey of bringing the Wichita Sewer and Drain website to life. Armed with a clear vision and a solid plan, I embarked on the technical endeavor of turning our conceptual designs into a functional digital space.</p>
                        <p>Choosing Azure Static Pages for hosting was a strategic move, aimed at leveraging the scalability and reliability of Microsoft's cloud services. This decision was complemented by the integration of Cloudflare for DNS management, ensuring not only the seamless distribution of web content but also enhanced security and performance. The synergy between Azure and Cloudflare provided a robust infrastructure that was both efficient and cost-effective.</p>
                        <p>The heart of the development process was rooted in GitHub, where I created a dedicated repository for the project. This platform became the central hub for version control and collaboration, allowing me to meticulously build and refine the website's features. GitHub Pages served as an invaluable tool, enabling me to share progress with Jonathan in real-time. This iterative approach, facilitated by simple git commits and pushes, ensured that we could rapidly implement feedback and make adjustments, keeping the project agile and aligned with our objectives.</p>
                        <p>The initial setup on GoDaddy, where the domain and email were already established, required careful integration. I created a support@wichitasewer.com account, which became the cornerstone for managing all necessary tools and services to build and promote the site. This step was crucial in streamlining communication and ensuring that all aspects of the website's infrastructure were cohesive and well-coordinated.</p>
                        <p>The final piece of the development puzzle was setting up an Azure Subscription for the Azure Static App instance. This process was seamlessly integrated with our GitHub repository, enabling a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow. This setup not only streamlined updates and maintenance but also reinforced the website's stability and responsiveness to changes.</p>
                        <p>The development and deployment phase was a testament to the power of modern web technologies and the importance of a well-structured workflow. It was a period of intense focus and technical rigor, where each line of code and every deployment decision was made with the user experience and the business's digital presence in mind.</p>
