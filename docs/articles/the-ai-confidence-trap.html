                                You know how we've all gotten used to asking ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever AI about pretty much everything?

These AI systems could be keeping us stuck on what I'm calling the

                                <h2 class="mb-0 text-info">How I Ended Up on This Mountain</h2>
                            </div>
                            <p class="mb-3">This whole thing started with some conversations I've been having with colleagues about how AI is changing the way we learn and work. We kept coming back to these psychological patterns that everyone seems to recognize but struggles to articulate.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">Confidence and competence don‚Äôt always show up together, and that tension can be revealing. The Dunning-Kruger effect often gets cited here‚Äîbut it‚Äôs frequently misunderstood. It‚Äôs not simply about people being clueless and cocky. The original research pointed to a broader idea: that early learners may overestimate their grasp of a topic, while true mastery brings a deeper awareness of complexity. Real expertise tends to wear its confidence differently‚Äînot with certainty, but with curiosity and precision.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">Then someone brought up imposter syndrome, and suddenly the whole discussion felt like a twist in the shape of the problem. If Dunning-Kruger maps a peak of early confidence that slowly levels out as knowledge deepens, imposter syndrome might resemble a dip in the terrain‚Äîcompetence without the confidence to claim it. It‚Äôs like looking at two points on the same topological surface: different elevations, but connected by the same underlying structure. Both distortions come from how we perceive ourselves in relation to what we know.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">As the conversation turned to AI, things got even more layered. These systems don‚Äôt just provide answers‚Äîthey package them with the polish and confidence of expertise. I started noticing how easy it is to internalize that tone, to mistake fluency for understanding. I‚Äôd ask a question, get a clean response, and feel like I was walking away smarter. But was I? Or was I just echoing certainty I hadn‚Äôt earned?</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">That‚Äôs when it hit me: we need a new way to think about this journey. The classic Dunning-Kruger curve doesn‚Äôt quite capture the learning loop when AI‚Äôs in the equation. And imposter syndrome? It‚Äôs still lurking, but showing up at odd times‚Äîsometimes right when we should be building confidence. AI isn‚Äôt just reshaping how we access information; it‚Äôs bending our sense of competence in subtle, powerful ways. It‚Äôs not just about what we know anymore, but how we think we know it.</p>
                            <div class="alert alert-primary mt-3">

What if the learning journey wasn't just about going from ignorant confidence to informed humility? What if AI was creating these new phases‚Äîextended periods of false confidence, deeper crashes, and different kinds of self-doubt?</p></div>

But here's where things diverge: AI flattens that peak into an extended Mesa of Illusory Mastery. Instead of quickly hitting reality and learning from it, you stay up high way longer than you should, even though you're not gaining real understanding.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">The Mesa of Illusory Mastery is the sneaky one‚Äîit's particularly dangerous because you're just sitting there, thinking you're learning, but you're not actually growing. AI masks your knowledge gaps and delays the humility that's actually necessary for real progress. Think about it: when you ask an AI about quantum computing, it gives you this polished explanation that sounds comprehensive. You walk away feeling like you "get it," but you haven't wrestled with the mathematical foundations, you haven't built intuition through practice, and you haven't hit the walls that force you to really understand the limitations.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">The AI response feels complete, so you stop digging deeper. Meanwhile, someone who struggled through textbooks, failed at problem sets, and had to rebuild their understanding multiple times has developed genuine expertise. The mesa keeps you comfortable in surface-level knowledge while real mastery requires discomfort, confusion, and the kind of deep engagement that AI can actually prevent. It's like having a trail guide that only shows you the main paths‚Äîyou feel like you know the mountain, but you're missing most of the terrain.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">Eventually, that mesa collapses into the Gorge of Realization‚Äîusually when you hit about 40% actual competence but your confidence crashes to around 20%. The fall is harder because you were up there longer. Think about it: you ask ChatGPT about climate change, it gives you this comprehensive-sounding response, and you walk away feeling informed. But climate science is incredibly complex, and that AI response was basically just a really good summary of the basics. The problem is, the AI doesn't tell you that, and you don't know to ask.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Normally, when you think you know something but don't, life corrects you. But with AI, you might never hit that reality check because the response seems so complete and authoritative. Without this feedback, you can't tell if you're actually climbing or just walking in circles on the mesa. When people get used to accepting AI-generated solutions without thinking about them, something weird happens. They stop engaging that critical thinking muscle. The research backs this up‚Äîrelying on AI outputs actually makes you worse at independent analysis.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">The Trough of Self-Doubt can trap genuinely capable people in a cycle of learned helplessness that's particularly insidious in our AI-assisted world. I've worked with developers who became so afraid of being wrong that they stopped trusting their own growing expertise, constantly second-guessing decisions they were actually qualified to make. Here's what happens: after that hard fall from the mesa, your confidence crashes deeper than your competence deserves.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">You start over-relying on external validation‚Äîwhether that's from AI tools, senior colleagues, or online resources‚Äîinstead of developing trust in your own judgment. The irony is that this happens right when you're actually starting to build real skills. You're making progress, but the memory of that earlier overconfidence makes you doubt everything. This creates a weird dependency where you become competent at using tools and resources but lose confidence in your ability to think independently. In software development, I've seen this manifest as developers who can solve complex problems but constantly seek approval for solutions they've already validated. The trough becomes a comfortable place to hide from the responsibility of expertise.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">The actual learning begins after the fall‚Äîthrough hard work, expert feedback, and honest self-reflection. But if AI keeps you on the mesa too long, you miss years of potential growth and the development of crucial meta-skills that can't be automated. Real expertise isn't just about knowing facts or even understanding concepts; it's about developing judgment, intuition, and the ability to navigate uncertainty. These skills come from making mistakes, recovering from failures, and gradually building confidence through repeated success in challenging situations.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">When AI extends your time on the mesa, you're not just delaying the inevitable crash‚Äîyou're missing the window where struggle would have built resilience. The people who make it through the traditional learning curve develop something invaluable: the ability to recognize what they don't know, to ask the right questions, and to push through confusion toward genuine understanding. They learn to trust their own thinking while remaining appropriately humble about their limitations. If you spend too long letting AI make you feel smart, you miss the opportunity to become genuinely capable. The mountain isn't just a metaphor for knowledge‚Äîit's a metaphor for the development of wisdom, judgment, and the kind of deep competence that comes from earning your expertise through experience.</p>

                            <strong>Stay in the Driver's Seat:</strong>
                            Treat AI as a research assistant who sometimes gets things wrong, not as the final authority. Always maintain your critical thinking and verify important information through multiple sources.

                            <strong>Practice on Purpose:</strong>
                            Regularly tackle problems that push you beyond what AI can easily handle. This builds the kind of deep understanding that comes from wrestling with complexity rather than accepting polished explanations.

                            <p class="mb-3">The challenge in our AI-assisted world isn't accessing information‚Äîit's developing the wisdom to know where we actually are on the mountain and the discipline to keep climbing even when a computer makes us feel like we've already reached the summit.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">AI should amplify our thinking, not replace it. When we use it right, it can help us explore ideas we never would have considered and tackle problems more effectively. But when we get lazy and just accept everything it tells us, we risk spending years on that Mesa of Illusory Mastery‚Äîfeeling smart while our actual capabilities stagnate.</p>

It's to use these tools in a way that helps us navigate the mountain more skillfully, with honest awareness of where we are and where we're actually going. That's a very human skill, and it's one we can't afford to lose.</p>
