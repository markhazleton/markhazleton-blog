            <p>This morning, I saw the 'Sora' icon on my ChatGPT Pro subscription and had the happy experience of diving into its text-to-video capabilities. After experimenting with a few prompts to generate videos, I decided to write this article to share my initial results and provide an overview of the tool. The interface was intuitive, and the options straightforward, making it easy for me to start creating. For me, Sora feels more like a novelty and a glimpse into better things to come than a complete revolution. However, it offers something I couldn't do before: the ability to create small video clips quickly and efficiently.</p>
            <p>I created a few videos using Sora to test its capabilities. I downloaded the vidoes as MP4s and then used Microsoft's Clipchqmp to create the YouTube vidoe you see below.</p>
