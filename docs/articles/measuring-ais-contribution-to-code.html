                                How a Simple Question Exposed a Complex Reality
                            </h2>
                            <p class="lead mb-4">The question hit me during what should have been a routine executive demo. I'd just finished presenting a new application we'd built—nothing groundbreaking, but functional and delivered quickly. The demo had gone well and I was happy I made my time window provided. Then can a question from an executive, "How much of this code was written by AI?"</p>
                            <p>I hesitated. It seemed like such a straightforward question, but as I opened my mouth to answer, I realized I genuinely didn't know. Was it the prompts I'd crafted in GitHub Copilot's agent mode? The code completions that appeared as I typed? The entire functions Claude generated from my specifications? The debugging cycles where I'd iterate with AI to fix issues? My hedged response—something about "significant AI assistance while maintaining human oversight" —earned me a pointed follow-up: "That sounds like you're avoiding the question."</p>
                            <p>They were right. I was avoiding it, but not out of evasiveness. I was avoiding it because the question, despite appearing simple, had exposed a fundamental measurement problem that I'd never seriously considered.</p>
                            <p>Later that evening, I attempted to quantify the AI contribution to that application. I estimated roughly 90% of the final code had originated from AI prompts and assistance rather than manual typing. But even as I calculated that percentage, I knew it was meaningless. What did "AI-generated" really mean when I had crafted every prompt, reviewed every output, debugged every integration, and taken responsibility for every architectural decision?</p>
                            <p>This led me down a rabbit hole of measurement complexity that I suspect many developers are quietly grappling with. In our rush to adopt transformative AI tools, we've created a new category of work that defies traditional software metrics. Git commits look identical whether they originated from human keystrokes or AI generation. Lines of code tell us nothing about cognitive effort or creative contribution. Traditional productivity measures crumble when the fundamental nature of the work has changed.</p>
                            <p>More troubling, I realized that the question itself carried an implicit judgment: if 90% was "AI-generated," was the developer 90% less valuable? Nothing could be further from the truth, yet the framing almost demanded that conclusion. This article is my attempt to work through the measurement challenge that executive's question exposed. It's about why traditional code metrics fail in an AI-augmented world, what new approaches might work better, and perhaps most importantly, how we can measure AI's impact without accidentally diminishing the substantial human expertise required to orchestrate these powerful tools effectively.</p>
                            <p>The answer to "How much code was AI-generated?" turns out to be far more complex—and far more interesting—than any percentage could capture.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">When a software executive asks "How much of this code was written by AI?", they're asking what seems like a straightforward question. But in practice, it's become one of the most difficult metrics to accurately measure in modern software development. Today's development environment creates a perfect storm of attribution complexity that makes traditional code metrics nearly useless for understanding AI contribution.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">Part of what makes the "How much was AI-generated?" question so difficult to answer is that it assumes a binary world that doesn't exist. In reality, AI assistance exists on a spectrum, and most modern development involves multiple levels simultaneously within the same project, file, or even function.</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">When we try to assign a single percentage to AI contribution, we're collapsing this spectrum into an oversimplified metric. A more honest assessment requires understanding the different types of AI assistance and recognizing that they often layer on top of each other in ways that make clean attribution nearly impossible.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">The most dangerous trend is developers who distance themselves from AI-assisted output. Whether code comes from human keystrokes or AI generation, the developer who commits it owns it completely—warts and all. The moment we start saying "the AI wrote that buggy function," we've lost the fundamental accountability that separates professional developers from code generators.</p>

                                <p class="lead mb-4">Smart enterprises aren't asking "How do we measure AI contribution?" but rather "How do we build systems that amplify human expertise while maintaining accountability?"

From there, I layered in more prompts, rewrites, and a few rabbit holes of exploration. Eventually, I handed it off to a custom GPT I built, which shaped it into something blog-worthy. Then GitHub Copilot helped me mop up the AI slop: bloated formatting, awkward phrasing, and the occasional hallucinated flourish. So while I can't tell you exactly how much of this article was written by AI, I can say with certainty—it wouldn't exist without it.</small></p>
