                While working on the AsyncSpark demonstration in my WebSpark project, I encountered a practical challenge: managing the request limits of the OpenWeather API. As most developers know, API request limits can be a tricky aspect, especially when working with limited resources. In search of a straightforward solution that wouldn't rely heavily on third-party libraries, I developed the MemoryCacheManager class. It's a no-fuss, efficient way to cache API calls – a simple yet effective tool that aligns well with the needs of a project like WebSpark. This article is a walk-through of how MemoryCacheManager fits into the picture, offering a modest peek into the world of caching in ASP.NET development.

            <h2>Code Walkthrough of MemoryCacheManager</h2>
            <p>The MemoryCacheManager class is a finely-tuned component designed to enhance the performance of ASP.NET applications through efficient caching. Let's take a closer look at its core parts:</p>
            <h3>Initialization and Setup</h3>
            <p>
                The class initializes a static
                <code>ConcurrentDictionary</code>
                ,
                <code>_allKeys</code>
                , to keep track of cache keys. This ensures thread safety and efficient management of cache keys. Additionally, an instance of
                <code>IMemoryCache</code>
                , provided by ASP.NET Core, is used for actual caching operations.
            </p>
            <h3>Cache Operations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adding to Cache:</strong>
                    The
                    <code>Set</code>
                    method adds items to the cache. It handles key management and sets cache options, including expiration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Retrieving from Cache:</strong>
                    The
                    <code>Get</code>
                    method fetches items, leveraging the cache-first strategy. If an item is not in cache, it’s loaded and then stored in cache for subsequent requests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Removing from Cache:</strong>
                    The
                    <code>Remove</code>
                    method removes items from the cache and updates the key dictionary accordingly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Eviction Policy</h3>
            <p>
                The class implements an eviction policy through the
                <code>PostEviction</code>
                callback. This method gets triggered when items are evicted from the cache, allowing for custom actions based on the eviction reason.
            </p>
            <h3>Cache Clearing and Disposal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clearing the Cache:</strong>
                    The
                    <code>Clear</code>
                    method iterates through all keys and removes each item from the cache, ensuring a clean state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Disposal Pattern:</strong>
                    While the current implementation of
                    <code>Dispose</code>
                    method is empty, it provides a structure for resource cleanup if needed in the future.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Concurrency and Lock Management</h3>
            <p>
                A unique feature is the
                <code>PerformActionWithLock</code>
                method, which ensures that actions are performed with exclusive access, preventing race conditions in multi-threaded scenarios.
            </p>

            <h3>CancellationTokenSource in MemoryCacheManager</h3>
            <p>
                There is an instance of the
                <code>CancellationTokenSource</code>
                <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtokensource">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtokensource</a>
                within the MemoryCacheManager class which plays a role in managing the lifecycle of cache entries. Let's delve into its purpose and functionality:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Purpose of CancellationTokenSource</dt>
                <dd>
                    The
                    <code>CancellationTokenSource</code>
                    is a powerful .NET construct used to signal cancellation in asynchronous and potentially long-running operations. In the context of the MemoryCacheManager, it serves to manage the expiration and clearing of cache entries.
                </dd>
                <dt>Managing Cache Lifespan</dt>
                <dd>
                    When a cache entry is added using the
                    <code>Set</code>
                    method, the
                    <code>CancellationTokenSource</code>
                    is tied to the cache entry's options. This integration allows for controlled expiration of cache items based on specific conditions or time frames.
                </dd>
                <dt>Controlled Cache Invalidation</dt>
                <dd>
                    In scenarios where there's a need to invalidate the cache prematurely, the
                    <code>CancellationTokenSource</code>
                </dd>
                <dt>Recreating the Token After Clearing</dt>
                <dd>
                    Upon invoking the can be used to cancel all associated cache entries. This mechanism is especially useful for implementing dynamic cache clearing strategies, where cache consistency is critical.
                    <code>Clear</code>
                    method, the
                    <code>CancellationTokenSource</code>
                    is canceled and disposed of, effectively clearing the cache. It’s then crucial to recreate the
                    <code>CancellationTokenSource</code>
                    to ensure that new cache entries can be added with their cancellation tokens, maintaining the integrity of cache management.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Overall, the in MemoryCacheManager adds a layer of flexibility and control over how cache entries are managed, ensuring that they can be invalidated as per application requirements, contributing to both the efficiency and reliability of caching mechanisms.</p>
