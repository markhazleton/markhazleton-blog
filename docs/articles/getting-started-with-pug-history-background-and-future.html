                    <h2 class="subheading mb-3">History, Background, and Future of a Template Engine</h2>
                    <p>PUG is a template engine for Node.js designed to simplify HTML creation with clean and concise syntax. It is widely used for generating dynamic web content, offering features such as Express integration, conditional rendering, and reusable mixins.</p>
                    <h2>History of PUG</h2>
                    <p>PUG, originally known as Jade, is a high-performance templating engine designed to simplify HTML creation for web developers. Initially released in 2010, Jade was praised for its clean and concise syntax, enabling developers to write readable and maintainable code. It gained significant traction in the Node.js ecosystem, becoming one of the most widely used templating engines during its early years. However, due to trademark issues surrounding the name "Jade," the project was renamed to PUG in 2016.</p>
                    <p>The renaming process marked a new chapter for the templating engine. Along with the name change, the team took the opportunity to introduce updates and improvements, ensuring that PUG stayed relevant in an ever-evolving web development landscape. The change also emphasized the project's focus on open-source collaboration and community-driven development. For more details about the renaming process, you can read the announcement on</p>

                    <p>Over the past few years, I have extensively used the PUG template engine in my personal website and various client projects. Its clean and intuitive syntax has been a game-changer for managing and maintaining multiple web development efforts. From simple static websites to more dynamic, content-driven platforms, PUG has consistently proven to be a reliable and efficient tool.</p>
                    <p>One of the biggest advantages I've found is how easily PUG integrates with the Node.js ecosystem. By leveraging PUG in combination with modern Node packages, I’ve been able to build websites that are not only visually appealing but also simple to maintain and update. The templating engine has streamlined my workflow, allowing me to focus more on delivering quality content and functionality rather than getting bogged down by complex HTML structures.</p>
                    <p>PUG has also been a key part of my static site generation strategy. For several projects, I’ve used PUG to build fast, static websites that are easy to deploy and require minimal upkeep. The ability to reuse components and apply dynamic logic in templates has significantly reduced development time while ensuring consistency across pages.</p>
                    <p>In my experience, PUG has been a cornerstone in creating efficient and scalable web solutions. Its flexibility, coupled with its strong compatibility with modern tools, makes it an invaluable asset for developers looking to produce high-quality, maintainable websites. Whether it's for a personal project or a professional one, I continue to rely on PUG to deliver exceptional results.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding PUG Mixins</h2>
                    <p>Mixins in PUG are a powerful feature that allows you to create reusable code snippets, making your templates cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain. They are particularly useful for generating repetitive HTML structures with varying data.</p>
                    <p>One practical application of PUG mixins in my projects was creating a dynamic Bootstrap carousel to showcase the websites I have built. Using mixins, I was able to define reusable components for the carousel structure and its captions, making it simple to iterate over project data and render the carousel dynamically.</p>
                    <h3>The Carousel Mixins</h3>
                    <p>Below is the code for the mixins I used. The first mixin, `carousel-caption`, generates the captions for each slide, while the second mixin, `carousel`, creates the overall carousel structure:</p>

                    <h3>How the Carousel Showcases Projects</h3>
                    <p>The `carousel` mixin is invoked with the `projects` data array to generate the entire carousel. Each slide displays a project with its image, description, and a link to view the project. The dynamic generation of slides ensures scalability, allowing new projects to be added easily without modifying the carousel structure.</p>
                    <p>Here is how the mixin is used in a card to display the carousel:</p>
                    <pre class="language-pug"><code class="language-pug"><span class="token tag"><span class="token attr-class">.card</span><span class="token attr-class">.mb4</span></span>
  <span class="token tag"><span class="token attr-class">.card-header</span></span>
    <span class="token tag">h2<span class="token attr-class">.card-title</span></span> <span class="token plain-text">Website Projects</span>
    <span class="token tag">p<span class="token attr-class">.card-text</span></span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token multiline-plain-text">
      These are some of the websites I have built. I have used a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ASP.Net.
      I have also used a variety of frameworks including Bootstrap, jQuery, and PUG Templates.</span>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Using PUG mixins for creating reusable components like this carousel has significantly streamlined my development workflow. It ensures consistency in design while making it easy to add, modify, or remove projects in the future. Mixins are a cornerstone of efficient PUG development, especially for dynamic, data-driven websites.</p>
