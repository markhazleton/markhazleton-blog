echo "üîç BUTTON CONFLICT RESOLUTION - SAVE vs AI GENERATION"
echo "====================================================="

echo ""
echo "üéØ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:"
echo "==================="
echo "Both 'Generate AI Content' and 'Save Project' buttons are type='submit'"
echo "When clicking 'Save Project', it might be triggering AI generation instead"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "===================="

echo ""
echo "1. üéØ Enhanced JavaScript Button Handling:"
echo "   - Save Project button explicitly removes formaction attributes"
echo "   - Clear console logging to identify which button was clicked"
echo "   - Different loading states for each button"

echo ""
echo "2. üìä Enhanced Method Logging:"
echo "   - OnPost(): 'THIS IS THE REGULAR SAVE, NOT AI GENERATION'"
echo "   - OnPostGenerateAiContentAsync(): 'THIS IS AI GENERATION, NOT SAVE'"
echo "   - Clear distinction in log messages"

echo ""
echo "3. üîß Button State Management:"
echo "   - Save button shows 'Saving Project...' when clicked"
echo "   - AI button shows 'Generating AI Content...' when clicked"
echo "   - Console logging for debugging"

echo ""
echo "üß™ TESTING STEPS:"
echo "================"

echo ""
echo "1. Start your application: dotnet run"

echo ""
echo "2. Navigate to Add Project page"

echo ""
echo "3. Fill in minimal data:"
echo "   - Repository URL: https://github.com/markhazleton/js-dev-env"
echo "   - Title: Test Save Button"

echo ""
echo "4. Test AI Generation (should work normally):"
echo "   - Click 'Generate AI Content'"
echo "   - Watch logs for: '[ProjectAdd] OnPostGenerateAiContentAsync() method called - THIS IS AI GENERATION, NOT SAVE'"
echo "   - Verify form populates with AI data"

echo ""
echo "5. Test Save Project (the real test):"
echo "   - Click 'Save Project' (NOT 'Generate AI Content')"
echo "   - Watch logs for: '[ProjectAdd] OnPost() method called - THIS IS THE REGULAR SAVE, NOT AI GENERATION'"
echo "   - Browser dev tools console should show: 'Save Project button clicked - submitting to OnPost()'"

echo ""
echo "üîç EXPECTED LOG SEQUENCE FOR SAVE:"
echo "================================="

echo ""
echo "When clicking 'Save Project':"
echo "[ProjectAdd] ===== STARTING PROJECT SAVE PROCESS ====="
echo "[ProjectAdd] OnPost() method called - THIS IS THE REGULAR SAVE, NOT AI GENERATION"
echo "[ProjectAdd] Model validation passed"
echo "[ProjectAdd] Calling ProjectService.AddProject..."
echo "[ProjectService] ===== STARTING ADD PROJECT PROCESS ====="
echo "[ProjectService] Adding project: Test Save Button"
echo "[ProjectService] Calling SaveProjects..."
echo "[ProjectService] ===== SAVE PROJECTS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ====="
echo "[ProjectAdd] ProjectService.AddProject completed successfully"
echo "[ProjectAdd] Redirecting to Projects page"

echo ""
echo "‚ùå WRONG LOG SEQUENCE (if bug still exists):"
echo "==========================================="

echo ""
echo "If you see this, the bug is still there:"
echo "[ProjectAdd] ===== STARTING AI GENERATION PROCESS ====="
echo "[ProjectAdd] OnPostGenerateAiContentAsync() method called - THIS IS AI GENERATION, NOT SAVE"
echo "(No save operation happens)"

echo ""
echo "üéØ DEBUGGING COMMANDS:"
echo "====================="

echo ""
echo "# Check project count before save"
echo "curl -k https://localhost:7219/api/test/debug-project-counts"

echo ""
echo "# After clicking Save Project, check again"
echo "curl -k https://localhost:7219/api/test/debug-project-counts"

echo ""
echo "# The count should increase by 1 if save worked"

echo ""
echo "üîß BROWSER DEBUGGING:"
echo "===================="

echo ""
echo "Open Browser Developer Tools (F12):"
echo "1. Go to Console tab"
echo "2. Click 'Save Project'"
echo "3. Look for: 'Save Project button clicked - submitting to OnPost()'"
echo "4. Check Network tab for the POST request"
echo "5. Verify the POST goes to /ProjectAdd (not /ProjectAdd?handler=GenerateAiContent)"

echo ""
echo "üåü SUCCESS INDICATORS:"
echo "====================="

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Save button working correctly if:"
echo "   - Logs show: 'OnPost() method called - THIS IS THE REGULAR SAVE'"
echo "   - Browser redirects to Projects page"
echo "   - Project count increases"
echo "   - New project appears in list"
echo "   - Console shows: 'Save Project button clicked'"

echo ""
echo "‚ùå Still broken if:"
echo "   - Logs show: 'OnPostGenerateAiContentAsync() method called'"
echo "   - Form stays on same page with AI generation messages"
echo "   - Project count doesn't increase"
echo "   - No redirect to Projects page"

echo ""
echo "üöÄ Test the Save Project button now and watch the logs!"
