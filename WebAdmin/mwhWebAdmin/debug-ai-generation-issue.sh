echo ""
echo "2. OPEN BROWSER DEVELOPER TOOLS:"
echo "   - Press F12"
echo "   - Go to Console tab"
echo "   - Clear any existing messages"

echo ""
echo "3. NAVIGATE TO ADD PROJECT:"
echo "   - Go to: /ProjectAdd"
echo "   - Fill in MINIMAL data:"
echo "     Repository URL: https://github.com/markhazleton/js-dev-env"
echo "     (Leave title and summary empty to test validation)"

echo ""
echo "4. TEST AI GENERATION WITH DEBUGGING:"
echo "   - Click 'Generate AI Content'"
echo "   - Watch BOTH browser console AND application logs"

echo ""
echo "üîç EXPECTED BROWSER CONSOLE OUTPUT:"
echo "==================================="

echo "üîß POTENTIAL ISSUES AND FIXES:"
echo "=============================="

echo ""
echo "üéØ ISSUE 1: JavaScript Validation Too Strict"
echo "SYMPTOMS: Alert popup prevents AI generation"
echo "SOLUTION: Provide at least one field (repository URL is best)"

echo ""
echo "üéØ ISSUE 2: Form Not Submitting to Correct Handler"
echo "SYMPTOMS: Form submits but logs show OnPost() instead of OnPostGenerateAiContentAsync()"
echo "SOLUTION: Check if asp-page-handler attribute is working"

echo ""
echo "üéØ ISSUE 3: JavaScript Error Preventing Submission"
echo "SYMPTOMS: No console logs appear, button doesn't respond"
echo "SOLUTION: Check browser console for JavaScript errors"

echo ""
echo "üéØ ISSUE 4: Model Binding Issues"
echo "SYMPTOMS: Form submits but fields are empty in backend"
echo "SOLUTION: Check model binding and property names"

echo ""
echo "üß™ QUICK TESTS:"
echo "=============="

echo ""
echo "TEST 1 - Minimum Data:"
echo "‚úÖ Repository URL: https://github.com/markhazleton/js-dev-env"
echo "‚úÖ Title: [empty]"
echo "‚úÖ Summary: [empty]"
echo "SHOULD: Pass validation and trigger AI generation"

echo ""
echo "TEST 2 - No Data:"
echo "‚ùå Repository URL: [empty]"
echo "‚ùå Title: [empty]"
echo "‚ùå Summary: [empty]"
echo "SHOULD: Show validation alert and prevent submission"

echo ""
echo "TEST 3 - Title Only:"
echo "‚ùå Repository URL: [empty]"
echo "‚úÖ Title: Test Project"
echo "‚ùå Summary: [empty]"
echo "SHOULD: Pass validation and trigger AI generation"

echo ""
echo "üîç NETWORK TAB DEBUGGING:"
echo "========================="

echo ""
echo "1. Open Network tab in browser dev tools"
echo "2. Click 'Generate AI Content'"
echo "3. Look for POST request:"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ CORRECT REQUEST:"
echo "POST /ProjectAdd?handler=GenerateAiContent"
echo "Status: 200 OK"
echo "Response: HTML page with populated fields"

echo ""
echo "‚ùå INCORRECT REQUEST:"
echo "POST /ProjectAdd (no handler parameter)"
echo "OR: No POST request at all (validation prevented)"

echo ""
echo "üöÄ QUICK FIX ATTEMPTS:"
echo "====================="

echo ""
echo "1. TRY WITH REPOSITORY URL ONLY:"
echo "   - Fill only Repository URL field"
echo "   - Click Generate AI Content"
echo "   - Should work if validation is the issue"

echo ""
echo "2. CHECK BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY:"
echo "   - Right-click 'Generate AI Content' button"
echo "   - Inspect element"
echo "   - Verify asp-page-handler=\"GenerateAiContent\" is present"

echo ""
echo "3. BYPASS VALIDATION TEMPORARILY:"
echo "   - Open browser console"
echo "   - Type: document.querySelector('button[asp-page-handler=\"GenerateAiContent\"]').click()"
echo "   - This bypasses JavaScript validation"

echo ""
echo "üéØ REPORT BACK WITH:"
echo "==================="
echo "1. Browser console output when clicking AI button"
echo "2. Application log output (if any)"
echo "3. Network tab requests"
echo "4. Whether form submits or gets blocked by validation"

echo ""
echo "üìù LIKELY CAUSE:"
echo "==============="
echo "The JavaScript validation is probably too strict and blocking"
echo "the AI generation when fields are empty. Try filling at least"
echo "the Repository URL field before clicking Generate AI Content."
