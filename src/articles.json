    "keywords": "{\u0022articleTitle\u0022:\u0022Troubleshooting JS-Dev-Env Project\u0022,\u0022articleDescription\u0022:\u0022Explore the challenges faced while troubleshooting a JavaScript development environment, including breaking changes and dependency conflicts, and learn how to rebuild a stable setup.\u0022,\u0022articleContent\u0022:\u0022# Troubleshooting JS-Dev-Env Project\\n\\n## A Story of Challenges, Breaking Changes, and Rebuilding from Scratch\\n\\nWhen I first set out to build a development environment for my JavaScript project, I envisioned a smooth, streamlined setup. I wanted a workspace where I could write modern JavaScript, manage dependencies effortlessly, lint my code, and run a local server with instant updates.\\n\\nHowever, what I didn\u2019t account for was the series of breaking changes in the core packages that made my initial environment incompatible with the newer versions of these tools.\\n\\n## Facing the Initial Issues and Breaking Changes\\n\\nThe first sign of trouble was when I tried to upgrade my core packages\u2014Node.js, Nodemon, and ESLint. Each package had introduced breaking changes that resulted in errors, version conflicts, and even the inability to run the project. The breaking changes in ESLint were the most frustrating. Several rules were deprecated, and new rule configurations required major changes to the \u0060.eslintrc\u0060 file. Additionally, the plugin \u0060eslint-plugin-import\u0060 began requiring newer versions of ESLint that weren\u2019t backward compatible with my original configuration.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\nnpm install eslint@latest eslint-plugin-import@latest\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nNodemon also underwent significant updates. The move to Nodemon 3.x came with breaking changes in how the watcher worked and how it interacted with my build scripts. The config settings I was using to handle auto-reloading became obsolete, causing the server to crash when certain files changed.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\\n\\\u0022dev\\\u0022: \\\u0022nodemon --watch src --exec node server.js\\\u0022\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nThese breaking changes led to a cascade of dependency issues, where some packages required older versions of Node.js, while others demanded the latest version. This mismatch made it nearly impossible to have a stable, functioning environment without sacrificing modern features.\\n\\n## Code Changes to Support New Versions\\n\\nTo resolve these issues, I had to update several parts of my codebase. First, I upgraded the project dependencies to the latest versions and updated the ESLint rules and configuration accordingly. For example, ESLint\u2019s newer rules required specific configuration changes. The deprecation of \u0060no-use-before-define\u0060 for functions required me to manually rewrite functions or disable the rule in the config file.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\\n\\\u0022rules\\\u0022: {\\n  \\\u0022no-use-before-define\\\u0022: [\\\u0022error\\\u0022, { \\\u0022functions\\\u0022: false }]\\n}\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nI also had to refactor my scripts to ensure compatibility with Nodemon\u2019s changes. The way the file watcher worked had changed, so I modified my script in \u0060package.json\u0060 to explicitly specify which directories to watch.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\\n\\\u0022scripts\\\u0022: {\\n  \\\u0022start\\\u0022: \\\u0022node server.js\\\u0022,\\n  \\\u0022dev\\\u0022: \\\u0022nodemon --watch \u0027src/**/*.js\u0027 --exec \u0027node server.js\u0027\\\u0022\\n}\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n## Troubleshooting Dependency Conflicts\\n\\nThe dependency conflicts were another major issue. Older versions of some libraries, such as Babel or TypeScript, wouldn\u2019t work properly with the newer versions of Node.js or ESLint. I had to experiment with different version combinations to find a setup that worked without too many compatibility issues. The conflicts between Node.js versions and specific package versions required that I settle on using Node.js 16.x, which was a stable release compatible with both ESLint and Nodemon. However, this still meant that I couldn\u2019t use certain cutting-edge features of Node.js 18.x without risking breaking the entire setup.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\\n\\\u0022engines\\\u0022: {\\n  \\\u0022node\\\u0022: \\\u0022\u003E=16.0.0\\\u0022\\n}\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nTo handle these issues, I relied on tools like \u0060nvm\u0060 (Node Version Manager) to switch between Node.js versions easily, allowing me to maintain different projects with different Node.js versions without causing issues in my overall environment.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\nnvm use 16\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n## The Decision to Start Over\\n\\nAfter countless hours spent troubleshooting, upgrading dependencies, and trying different combinations, I realized that my dev environment was a patchwork of fixes that lacked stability. I made the tough decision to scrap the original environment and start fresh with a minimalist setup that only included the essentials. This decision was key in reducing complexity and avoiding further dependency conflicts. I chose to start with the basics: a simple server, a linter, and a few essential packages. Once that was stable, I could expand incrementally.\\n\\n## Lessons Learned from Breaking Changes\\n\\nThe experience of troubleshooting breaking changes taught me valuable lessons about maintaining a development environment:\\n\\n1. **Stick to LTS Versions**: Always aim for Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Node.js and other core packages to avoid running into cutting-edge changes that could break backward compatibility.\\n2. **Understand Your Dependencies**: Before upgrading any package, especially major versions, review the changelogs and release notes to understand what breaking changes have been introduced.\\n3. **Use Version Locking**: Using \u0060package-lock.json\u0060 or \u0060yarn.lock\u0060 files can save a lot of trouble by ensuring consistent dependency versions across different environments.\\n4. **Refactor Incrementally**: When upgrading or fixing breaking changes, it\u2019s better to refactor your codebase step-by-step, rather than trying to overhaul everything at once.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Starting Fresh After Breaking Changes\\n\\nThe breaking changes to Node.js, ESLint, and Nodemon forced me to re-evaluate my initial approach. By starting fresh and focusing on core functionality, I was able to create a more stable and maintainable development environment. This experience reinforced the importance of simplicity and version management in modern development workflows.\\n\\n## Rebuilding My JS-Dev-Env Project\\n\\nWhen I first set out to build a development environment for my JavaScript project, I envisioned a smooth, streamlined setup that would support all my needs. I wanted a workspace where I could write modern JavaScript, manage dependencies effortlessly, lint my code, and run a local server with instant updates.\\n\\nBut things didn\u0027t go as planned. Here is how I built a functional dev environment from scratch.\\n\\n### Building a Basic Development Environment\\n\\nI started fresh, deleting everything in my folder except for \u0060.git\u0060 and starting over. At least I would have a history of before and after.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\ncd js-dev-env\\nnpm init -y\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nI installed core packages like Express, Nodemon, EJS, and Bootstrap.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\nnpm install express nodemon ejs bootstrap\\nnpm install --save-dev nodemon\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\nI then added basic scripts to \u0060package.json\u0060.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\\n\\\u0022scripts\\\u0022: {\\n  \\\u0022start\\\u0022: \\\u0022node server.js\\\u0022,\\n  \\\u0022dev\\\u0022: \\\u0022nodemon server.js\\\u0022\\n}\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n### Building the Basic Site\\n\\nI set up a simple Express server to serve content and EJS templates.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060javascript\\nconst express = require(\u0027express\u0027);\\nconst path = require(\u0027path\u0027);\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.set(\u0027view engine\u0027, \u0027ejs\u0027);\\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \u0027public\u0027)));\\n\\napp.get(\u0027/\u0027, (req, res) =\u003E {\\n  res.render(\u0027index\u0027, { title: \u0027Home\u0027 });\\n});\\n\\napp.listen(3000, () =\u003E {\\n  console.log(\u0027Server running on http://localhost:3000\u0027);\\n});\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n### Running the Site\\n\\nWith everything set up, I used Nodemon to run the development server.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\nnpm run dev\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n## Conclusion: Lessons Learned\\n\\nIn the end, starting over helped me streamline my development environment. By going back to basics, I was able to:\\n\\n- Use Express to serve static content and manage routes.\\n- Integrate Nodemon to automatically restart the server on changes during development.\\n- Employ EJS to easily manage templates and layouts.\\n- Utilize Bootstrap to simplify styling without writing custom CSS.\\n\\nThis approach not only simplified my development process but taught me the value of focusing on core functionality first.\\n\\n## Dynamic Content and Navigation\\n\\n### Simplify Content Management and Navigation Using a JSON File\\n\\nI decided I wanted some dynamic content and navigation in the project. I added a \u0060pages.json\u0060 file to dynamically control both the content and navigation of the pages in my JS-Dev-Env project. This approach allows you to manage your site\u0027s content and navigation links without hardcoding them, making it much easier to update or add new pages later on.\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\nBefore starting, ensure the following is in place:\\n\\n- Node.js installed\\n- Express set up to handle routes\\n- EJS templating engine\\n- Bootstrap for styling\\n\\n#### Step 1: Create the \u0060pages.json\u0060 File\\n\\nThe \u0060pages.json\u0060 file will hold details for all your site\u0027s pages, such as the title, URL, template, and content. This will allow you to dynamically generate both pages and navigation. First, create a \u0060data\u0060 folder in the root of your project, and inside it, create a \u0060pages.json\u0060 file. Here\u0027s an example of how to structure your JSON file:\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\u0022title\\\u0022: \\\u0022Home\\\u0022,\\n    \\\u0022url\\\u0022: \\\u0022/\\\u0022,\\n    \\\u0022template\\\u0022: \\\u0022page\\\u0022,\\n    \\\u0022content\\\u0022: {\\n      \\\u0022heading\\\u0022: \\\u0022Welcome to My Bootstrap 5 Website\\\u0022,\\n      \\\u0022text\\\u0022: \\\u0022This is the home page.\\\u0022\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\u0022title\\\u0022: \\\u0022About\\\u0022,\\n    \\\u0022url\\\u0022: \\\u0022/about\\\u0022,\\n    \\\u0022template\\\u0022: \\\u0022page\\\u0022,\\n    \\\u0022content\\\u0022: {\\n      \\\u0022heading\\\u0022: \\\u0022About Us\\\u0022,\\n      \\\u0022text\\\u0022: \\\u0022This is the about page. Learn more about us here.\\\u0022\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\u0022title\\\u0022: \\\u0022Contact\\\u0022,\\n    \\\u0022url\\\u0022: \\\u0022/contact\\\u0022,\\n    \\\u0022template\\\u0022: \\\u0022page\\\u0022,\\n    \\\u0022content\\\u0022: {\\n      \\\u0022heading\\\u0022: \\\u0022Contact Us\\\u0022,\\n      \\\u0022text\\\u0022: \\\u0022Get in touch with us using the form below.\\\u0022\\n    }\\n  }\\n]\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n#### Step 2: Modify \u0060index.js\u0060 to Use \u0060pages.json\u0060\\n\\nNow, update your \u0060index.js\u0060 file to read the \u0060pages.json\u0060 data and generate routes dynamically. This step also involves extracting the top-level pages for the navigation bar and passing them to EJS templates.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060javascript\\nconst express = require(\u0027express\u0027);\\nconst path = require(\u0027path\u0027);\\nconst fs = require(\u0027fs\u0027);\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.set(\u0027view engine\u0027, \u0027ejs\u0027);\\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \u0027public\u0027)));\\n\\n// Read the pages.json file\\nconst pagesData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, \u0027data\u0027, \u0027pages.json\u0027), \u0027utf-8\u0027));\\n\\n// Filter top-level pages for navigation\\nconst topLevelPages = pagesData.filter(page =\u003E (page.url.match(/\\\\//g) || []).length === 1);\\n\\n// Generate dynamic routes from pages.json\\npagesData.forEach(page =\u003E {\\n  app.get(page.url, (req, res) =\u003E {\\n    res.render(page.template, {\\n      title: page.title,\\n      heading: page.content.heading,\\n      text: page.content.text,\\n      pages: topLevelPages  // Pass navigation items\\n    });\\n  });\\n});\\n\\n// Start the server\\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\\napp.listen(port, () =\u003E {\\n  console.log(\u0060Server running at http://localhost:${port}/\u0060);\\n});\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n#### Step 3: Update the Layout to Include Dynamic Navigation\\n\\nNext, update the \u0060layout.ejs\u0060 file to dynamically render the navigation bar based on the \u0060pages.json\u0060 data. This avoids hardcoding navigation links in every template and makes it easier to manage as new pages are added.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060html\\n\u003C!DOCTYPE html\u003E\\n\u003Chtml lang=\\\u0022en\\\u0022\u003E\\n\u003Chead\u003E\\n  \u003Cmeta charset=\\\u0022UTF-8\\\u0022\u003E\\n  \u003Cmeta name=\\\u0022viewport\\\u0022 content=\\\u0022width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\u0022\u003E\\n  \u003Ctitle\u003E\u003C%= title %\u003E\u003C/title\u003E\\n  \u003Clink href=\\\u0022/css/modern-styles.css\\\u0022 rel=\\\u0022stylesheet\\\u0022\u003E\\n\u003C/head\u003E\\n\u003Cbody\u003E\\n  \u003C!-- Dynamic Navigation Bar --\u003E\\n  \u003Cnav class=\\\u0022navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light\\\u0022\u003E\\n    \u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022container-fluid\\\u0022\u003E\\n      \u003Ca class=\\\u0022navbar-brand\\\u0022 href=\\\u0022/\\\u0022\u003EMy Site\u003C/a\u003E\\n      \u003Cbutton class=\\\u0022navbar-toggler\\\u0022 type=\\\u0022button\\\u0022 data-bs-toggle=\\\u0022collapse\\\u0022 data-bs-target=\\\u0022#navbarNav\\\u0022 aria-controls=\\\u0022navbarNav\\\u0022 aria-expanded=\\\u0022false\\\u0022\u003E\\n        \u003Cspan class=\\\u0022navbar-toggler-icon\\\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\\n      \u003C/button\u003E\\n      \u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022collapse navbar-collapse\\\u0022 id=\\\u0022navbarNav\\\u0022\u003E\\n        \u003Cul class=\\\u0022navbar-nav ms-auto\\\u0022\u003E\\n          \u003C% pages.forEach(function(page) { %\u003E\\n            \u003Cli class=\\\u0022nav-item\\\u0022\u003E\\n              \u003Ca class=\\\u0022nav-link\\\u0022 href=\\\u0022\u003C%= page.url %\u003E\\\u0022\u003E\u003C%= page.title %\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\\n            \u003C/li\u003E\\n          \u003C% }); %\u003E\\n        \u003C/ul\u003E\\n      \u003C/div\u003E\\n    \u003C/div\u003E\\n  \u003C/nav\u003E\\n  \u003C!-- Main Content --\u003E\\n  \u003Cmain class=\\\u0022container mt-5\\\u0022\u003E\\n    \u003Ch1\u003E\u003C%= heading %\u003E\u003C/h1\u003E\\n    \u003Cp\u003E\u003C%= text %\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\\n    \u003C%- body %\u003E \u003C!-- View content will be injected here --\u003E\\n  \u003C/main\u003E\\n\u003C/body\u003E\\n\u003C/html\u003E\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n#### Step 4: Create EJS Templates for Each Page\\n\\nEach page in the \u0060pages.json\u0060 file needs a corresponding EJS template.

By simplifying the integration, the chat completions implementation becomes more efficient and effective, embracing a continuous learning approach. This transition underscores the importance of staying open to better, streamlined methods as new insights emerge, allowing us to build more responsive, user-centric applications.\\n\\n## Building an AI-driven, Real-time Chat\\n\\nThis guide covers the steps to create an interactive chat experience using ASP.NET SignalR for real-time functionality and OpenAI\u0027s GPT models for intelligent responses, through Semantic Kernel. The goal is to simplify and enhance the process of embedding chat completions, making the design more efficient and ready for a VIT React Native environment.\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nIn this article, developers and solution architects will learn how to integrate ASP.NET SignalR with Semantic Kernel\u0027s chat completion service to build a responsive, intelligent chat application in PromptSpark. SignalR enables real-time communication, while Semantic Kernel leverages OpenAI\u0027s GPT models for contextually relevant responses.\\n\\n### What You\u2019ll Build and Why It Matters\\n\\nYou\u2019ll create an interactive chat application where users receive immediate, AI-generated responses, closely simulating natural conversation flow. Combining SignalR\u0027s real-time messaging and Semantic Kernel\u0027s adaptive AI enhances engagement, suitable for use cases like customer support, virtual assistants, and interactive content.\\n\\n### Setting Up Your Development Environment\\n\\nThis project requires ASP.NET Core, SignalR, and Semantic Kernel. Follow these steps to set up your environment and secure your OpenAI API keys with environment variables.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\\ndotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR\\ndotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n### Setting Up Program.cs\\n\\nIn this section, we\u2019ll set up the main program configuration in \u0060Program.cs\u0060 for the integration of SignalR and OpenAI\u2019s GPT models via Semantic Kernel. This configuration ensures real-time functionality and prepares the AI chat service for prompt responses.\\n\\n#### Logging Configuration\\n\\nAdd console logging for debugging and set a debug level to capture detailed information.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\\nbuilder.Logging.AddConsole();\\nbuilder.Logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n#### SignalR Setup\\n\\nAdd SignalR to the services, enabling real-time messaging capabilities in the application.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\\nbuilder.Services.AddSignalR();\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n#### OpenAI API Integration\\n\\nConfigure Semantic Kernel\u2019s \u0060AddOpenAIChatCompletion\u0060 service, using API keys stored in environment variables. Ensure the environment variables \u0060OPENAI_API_KEY\u0060 and \u0060MODEL_ID\u0060 are correctly set to avoid errors.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\\nstring apikey = builder.Configuration.GetValue\u003Cstring\u003E(\\\u0022OPENAI_API_KEY\\\u0022) ?? \\\u0022not found\\\u0022;\\nstring modelId = builder.Configuration.GetValue\u003Cstring\u003E(\\\u0022MODEL_ID\\\u0022) ?? \\\u0022gpt-4o\\\u0022;\\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenAIChatCompletion(modelId, apikey);\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n#### Routing and Middleware\\n\\nMap routes for API controllers and the SignalR \u0060ChatHub\u0060, enabling endpoint access and serving static files like the front-end HTML.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\\nvar app = builder.Build();\\napp.UseDefaultFiles();  // Looks for index.html, index.htm by default\\napp.UseStaticFiles();\\n\\napp.MapControllers();\\napp.MapHub\u003CChatHub\u003E(\\\u0022/chatHub\\\u0022);\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n### Implementing the SignalR Chat Hub\\n\\nThe ChatHub manages messages, maintains conversation history, and processes real-time user interactions. Below is the implementation of the \u0060ChatHub\u0060 class, which initializes with an instance of \u0060IChatCompletionService\u0060 and manages message flow with a \u0060ConcurrentDictionary\u0060 for chat history.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\\npublic class ChatHub(IChatCompletionService _chatCompletionService) : Hub\\n{\\n  public class ChatEntry\\n  {\\n    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }\\n    public string User { get; set; }\\n    public string UserMessage { get; set; }\\n    public string BotResponse { get; set; }\\n  }\\n\\n  private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary\u003Cstring, List\u003CChatEntry\u003E\u003E ChatHistoryCache = new();\\n\\n  public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message, string conversationId)\\n  {\\n    if (!ChatHistoryCache.ContainsKey(conversationId))\\n    {\\n      ChatHistoryCache[conversationId] = new List\u003CChatEntry\u003E();\\n    }\\n    var timestamp = DateTime.Now;\\n\\n    // Broadcast user\u0027s message\\n    await Clients.All.SendAsync(\\\u0022ReceiveMessage\\\u0022, user, message, conversationId);\\n\\n    var chatHistory = new ChatHistory();\\n    chatHistory.AddSystemMessage(\\\u0022You are in a conversation, keep your answers brief, always ask follow-up questions, ask if ready for full answer.\\\u0022);\\n\\n    foreach (var chatEntry in ChatHistoryCache[conversationId])\\n    {\\n      chatHistory.AddUserMessage(chatEntry.UserMessage);\\n      chatHistory.AddSystemMessage(chatEntry.BotResponse);\\n    }\\n    chatHistory.AddUserMessage(message);\\n\\n    // Generate bot response with streaming\\n    var botResponse = await GenerateStreamingBotResponse(chatHistory, conversationId);\\n\\n    // Add the message to the in-memory cache\\n    ChatHistoryCache[conversationId].Add(new ChatEntry\\n    {\\n      Timestamp = timestamp,\\n      User = user,\\n      UserMessage = message,\\n      BotResponse = botResponse\\n    });\\n  }\\n\\n  private async Task\u003Cstring\u003E GenerateStreamingBotResponse(ChatHistory chatHistory, string conversationId)\\n  {\\n    var buffer = new StringBuilder();\\n    var message = new StringBuilder();\\n    try\\n    {\\n      await foreach (var response in _chatCompletionService.GetStreamingChatMessageContentsAsync(chatHistory))\\n      {\\n        if (response?.Content != null)\\n        {\\n          buffer.Append(response.Content);\\n\\n          if (response.Content.Contains(\u0027\\\\n\u0027))\\n          {\\n            var contentToSend = buffer.ToString();\\n            await Clients.All.SendAsync(\\\u0022ReceiveMessage\\\u0022, \\\u0022ChatBot\\\u0022, contentToSend, conversationId);\\n            await AppendToCsvLog(conversationId, \\\u0022System\\\u0022, contentToSend);\\n            message.Append(contentToSend);\\n            buffer.Clear();\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }\\n\\n      if (buffer.Length \u003E 0)\\n      {\\n        var remainingContent = buffer.ToString();\\n        await Clients.All.SendAsync(\\\u0022ReceiveMessage\\\u0022, \\\u0022ChatBot\\\u0022, remainingContent, conversationId);\\n        message.Append(remainingContent);\\n        await AppendToCsvLog(conversationId, \\\u0022System\\\u0022, remainingContent);\\n      }\\n    }\\n    catch (Exception ex)\\n    {\\n      Console.WriteLine($\\\u0022Error in generating bot response: {ex.Message}\\\u0022);\\n      message.Append(\\\u0022An error occurred while processing your request.\\\u0022);\\n      await Clients.Caller.SendAsync(\\\u0022ReceiveMessage\\\u0022, \\\u0022System\\\u0022, \\\u0022An error occurred while processing your request.\\\u0022);\\n    }\\n    return message.ToString();\\n  }\\n\\n  private async Task AppendToCsvLog(string conversationId, string sender, string message)\\n  {\\n    Console.WriteLine($\\\u0022{DateTime.Now}, {conversationId}, {sender}: {message}\\\u0022);\\n  }\\n}\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n### Generating AI-Powered Responses with Semantic Kernel\\n\\nThe \u0060GenerateStreamingBotResponse\u0060 method in the ChatHub class generates responses asynchronously. This method streams responses to the client in real-time, providing a continuous \\\u0022typing\\\u0022 effect for a more dynamic chat experience.\\n\\n### Building the Front-End for PromptSpark Chat\\n\\nSet up a user-friendly interface with an input box, chat history window, and \u201Csend\u201D button. Establish a SignalR connection for real-time messaging, and use streaming for a \u201Ctyping\u201D effect in AI responses.\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060javascript\\nconst connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()\\n  .withUrl(\\\u0022/chathub\\\u0022)\\n  .build();\\n\\nconnection.on(\\\u0022ReceiveMessage\\\u0022, (user, message, conversationId) =\u003E {\\n  // Display received messages\\n});\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n### Front-End Testing with index.html\\n\\nCreate a simple test harness \u0027index.html\u0027 in the wwwroot folder for the interactive chat interface.

Using mixins, I was able to define reusable components for the carousel structure and its captions, making it simple to iterate over project data and render the carousel dynamically.\\n\\n#### The Carousel Mixins\\n\\nBelow is the code for the mixins I used. The first mixin, \u0060carousel-caption\u0060, generates the captions for each slide, while the second mixin, \u0060carousel\u0060, creates the overall carousel structure:\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060pug\\n//- carousel caption\\nmixin carousel-caption(item)\\n  .carousel-caption\\n    unless !item.h1\\n    unless !item.p\\n    unless !item.button\\n  p\\n    a.btn.btn-lg.btn-primary(href=item.button.url role=\\\u0022button\\\u0022) #{item.button.caption}\\n\\n//- carousel\\nmixin carousel(id, items)\\n  .carousel.slide.carousel-dark(id=\\\u0022carousel-\\\u0022 \u002B id ,data-bs-ride=\\\u0022carousel\\\u0022)\\n    //- Indicators\\n    .carousel-indicators\\n      each item, index in items\\n        if(index === 0)\\n          button.active(type=\\\u0022button\\\u0022, data-bs-target=\\\u0022#carousel-\\\u0022 \u002B id, data-bs-slide-to=index, aria-current=\\\u0022true\\\u0022, aria-label=\\\u0022Slide \\\u0022 \u002B (index \u002B 1))\\n        else\\n          button(type=\\\u0022button\\\u0022, data-bs-target=\\\u0022#carousel-\\\u0022 \u002B id, data-bs-slide-to=index, aria-label=\\\u0022Slide \\\u0022 \u002B (index \u002B 1))\\n  //- Wrapper for slides\\n  .carousel-inner()\\n    each item, index in items\\n      if(index === 0)\\n        .carousel-item.active\\n          .card\\n            .card-header.text-center\\n              a(href=item.h target=\\\u0022_blank\\\u0022 rel=\\\u0022noopener noreferrer\\\u0022 title=item.p)=item.p\\n            .card-body\\n              img.img-fluid(src=item.image title=item.h alt=item.p)\\n              p.text-black=item.d\\n          \u002Bcarousel-caption(item)\\n      else\\n        .carousel-item\\n          .card\\n            .card-header.text-center\\n              a(href=item.h target=\\\u0022_blank\\\u0022 rel=\\\u0022noopener noreferrer\\\u0022 title=item.p)=item.p\\n            .card-body\\n              img.img-fluid(src=item.image title=item.h alt=item.p)\\n              p.text-black=item.d\\n          \u002Bcarousel-caption(item)\\n\\n  //- Controls\\n  button.carousel-control-prev(data-bs-target=\\\u0022#carousel-\\\u0022 \u002B id, data-bs-slide=\\\u0022prev\\\u0022, type=\\\u0022button\\\u0022)\\n    span.carousel-control-prev-icon(aria-hidden=\\\u0022true\\\u0022)\\n    span.visualy-hidden Previous\\n  button.carousel-control-next(data-bs-target=\\\u0022#carousel-\\\u0022 \u002B id, data-bs-slide=\\\u0022next\\\u0022, type=\\\u0022button\\\u0022)\\n    span.carousel-control-next-icon(aria-hidden=\\\u0022true\\\u0022)\\n    span.visualy-hidden Next\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n### How the Carousel Showcases Projects\\n\\nThe \u0060carousel\u0060 mixin is invoked with the \u0060projects\u0060 data array to generate the entire carousel. Each slide displays a project with its image, description, and a link to view the project. The dynamic generation of slides ensures scalability, allowing new projects to be added easily without modifying the carousel structure.\\n\\nHere is how the mixin is used in a card to display the carousel:\\n\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060pug\\n.card.mb4\\n  .card-header\\n    h2.card-title Website Projects\\n    p.card-text.\\n      These are some of the websites I have built. I have used a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ASP.Net.\\n      I have also used a variety of frameworks including Bootstrap, jQuery, and PUG Templates.\\n  .card-body\\n    \u002Bcarousel(\\\u0022Projects\\\u0022, projects)\\n  .card-footer\\n    p\\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUsing PUG mixins for creating reusable components like this carousel has significantly streamlined my development workflow. It ensures consistency in design while making it easy to add, modify, or remove projects in the future. Mixins are a cornerstone of efficient PUG development, especially for dynamic, data-driven websites.\u0022,\u0022keywords\u0022:\u0022PUG, Node.js, template engine, Mark Hazleton, web development, Express.js, SEO\u0022,\u0022seoTitle\u0022:\u0022Getting Started with PUG: A Template Engine | Mark Hazleton\u0022,\u0022metaDescription\u0022:\u0022Discover the history, features, and future of PUG, a Node.js template engine.

    "summary": "Specs always become outdated because humans won\u0027t maintain them post-implementation. GitHub\u0027s Spec Kit solves this with AI agents in the feedback loop: when you fix bugs and tweak implementations, you tell the agent to update the spec. Documentation evolves to match reality. Real-world case: 7 hours implementation \u002B 20 minutes documentation sync = zero documentation debt.",
    "conclusionTitle": "When to Use Spec Kit vs. Skip It",
    "conclusionSummary": "Spec Kit doesn\u0027t eliminate iteration\u2014it ensures iteration improves documentation instead of destroying it. The ROI isn\u0027t speed\u2014it\u0027s having specs that are still accurate a year later. Use it when institutional knowledge matters: libraries, APIs, multi-year projects. Skip it for throwaway prototypes or solo projects you\u0027ll rewrite in 6 months.",
    "conclusionKeyHeading": "The Real Value Proposition",
    "conclusionKeyText": "Implementation time stays the same. But specs stay accurate. 20 minutes of AI-assisted sync vs. never updating documentation. Six months later, new developers read accurate specs instead of reverse-engineering from code.",
    "conclusionText": "Start small: one SPEC.md with clear acceptance criteria. After implementation, spend 20 minutes having the agent update the spec to match what you actually built. The next developer (or future you) will thank you for documentation that describes what actually works\u2014not what you planned before reality intervened.",
