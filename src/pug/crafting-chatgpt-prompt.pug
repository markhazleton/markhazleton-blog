              | ChatGPT is a remarkable tool with impressive capabilities. Since its launch in 2022, ChatGPT has become a prominent player in the AI landscape, attracting over 100 million users in record time. The key to its remarkable performance lies in a crucial element: prompt engineering.

            section.mb-5
              h2.h3.mb-4 Why Prompts Matter
              p
                | ChatGPT's success is built on its ability to understand and mimic human conversation nuances. It's trained on diverse internet text, enabling it to generate creative responses, navigate complex dialogues, and even exhibit a sense of humor. However, it's important to note that ChatGPT doesn't truly understand or have beliefs; it generates responses based on patterns learned during training.
              p
                | ChatGPT generates output based on statistical patterns learned from vast amounts of data, without having an inherent understanding of what is true or false. It operates by analyzing the prompt, which is essentially a sequence of tokens representing the input text. You can see this in action by using the Tokenizer on the OpenAI website.

              p
                | ChatGPT uses the list of token IDs to predict the most likely sequence of tokens that should follow, drawing upon the patterns it learned during training. It cannot reason or comprehend the deeper meaning behind the information it generates.
              p
                | Understanding how it works is crucial to using ChatGPT effectively. It can be a valuable tool for generating code, unit tests, boilerplate methods, and various language-related tasks. As with any tool, it is up to the user to cross-check its outputs for accuracy and validity, particularly when it comes to critical or factual information.

                | Once upon a time, there lived a curious little girl named Goldilocks who stumbled upon the bears' cottage. Finding the door ajar, she entered the house and discovered three bowls of porridge on the dining table. She tried each one but found Papa Bear's porridge too hot, Mama Bear's porridge too cold, and Baby Bear's porridge just right. Hungry from her adventure, Goldilocks devoured all the porridge from Baby Bear's bowl.
              p
                | Just like Goldilocks seeking the perfect porridge, finding the right amount of context in your ChatGPT prompt is essential for the best results.
