            h2.mb-4 What Does "Sidetracked by Sizzle" Mean?

            p.lead.
              The phrase "Sidetracked by Sizzle" encapsulates those moments when the allure of tech novelties momentarily
              veers us off the path of practicality. It's about being lured by a glossy facade, often at the
              expense of substance.

            p.
              I often add "Not Sidetracked by Sizzle" in my online profiles,
              as a lighthearted testament to my commitment to staying the course,
              valuing the essence over the enticement.
              Much like resisting the urge to buy every new gadget that hits the
              market (looking at you, smart toaster with a built-in weather forecast),
              it's about keeping a keen eye on what truly matters.

            p.
              By maintaining a focus on the tangible benefits to the business, it becomes possible
              to deliver more effective and successful solutions.

            h2 Recognizing When You've Been Sidetracked by Sizzle

            p.
              There are several signs that can indicate when you've been sidetracked by sizzle:

            .warning-list.mb-4
              ul.list-unstyled.mb-0
                li.d-flex.align-items-start
                  i.fas.fa-exclamation-triangle.text-warning.me-3.mt-1
                  div
                    strong Perception Over Impact:
                    | When you find yourself more focused on the perceived value of a feature,
                    | rather than its actual impact on the business, it's a red flag.
                    | For instance, being enamored by a feature's cutting-edge technology,
                    | without a clear understanding of how it solves a business problem.

                li.d-flex.align-items-start
                  i.fas.fa-clock.text-warning.me-3.mt-1
                  div
                    strong Resource Misallocation:
                    | When you realize that a significant amount of time and resources have been invested into a feature,
                    | yet its benefits to the business remain unclear.

                li.d-flex.align-items-start
                  i.fas.fa-eye.text-warning.me-3.mt-1
                  div
                    strong Impression Over Solution:
                    | When you are aiming to impress stakeholders with flashy features,
                    | rather than addressing their real needs, it's time to pause.
                    | This might look like showcasing a high-tech dashboard while core functionality issues remain unresolved.

                li.d-flex.align-items-start
                  i.fas.fa-shield-alt.text-warning.me-3.mt-1
                  div
                    strong Misaligned Priorities:
                    | When you discover that your attention is gravitating toward features
                    | not directly aligned with the business goals or objectives.

                li.d-flex.align-items-start
                  i.fas.fa-shield-alt.text-warning.me-3.mt-1
                  div
                    strong Risk Blindness:
                    | When you overlook the potential risks or downsides of a feature,
                    | and stray from a risk management approach in decision-making.

                | Key Takeaway
              p.mb-0.
                When any of these scenarios occur, it's a cue to step back,
                reevaluate the priorities, and refocus on solutions
                that will truly benefit the business and contribute to its success.

            h2 How to Avoid Being Sidetracked by Sizzle

            p.
              There are several strategies to keep in mind when evaluating a solution to avoid
              being sidetracked by sizzle that does not deliver:

            .row.g-4.mb-5
              .col-md-6
                .strategy-card.h-100
                  .card-body
                    .d-flex.align-items-center.mb-3
                      i.fas.fa-bullseye.text-primary.fa-2x.me-3
                      h4.card-title.mb-0 Keep Business Goals in Focus
                    p.card-text.m-3.
                      It's important to keep the big picture in mind and remember the ultimate goals of the business.
                      This can help you stay focused on what's most important and avoid getting distracted
                      by flashy features or technologies that may not contribute to the business's success.

              .col-md-6
                .strategy-card.h-100
                  .card-body
                    .d-flex.align-items-center.mb-3
                      i.fas.fa-graduation-cap.text-primary.fa-2x.me-3
                      h4.card-title.mb-0 Gather Subject Matter Knowledge
                    p.card-text.m-3.
                      By gaining a deep understanding of the business and the specific needs and challenges it faces,
                      you can better evaluate whether a particular solution or technology will truly be beneficial.

              .col-md-6
                .strategy-card.h-100
                  .card-body
                    .d-flex.align-items-center.mb-3
                      i.fas.fa-comments.text-primary.fa-2x.me-3
                      h4.card-title.mb-0 Seek Customer Feedback
                    p.card-text.m-3.
                      Asking customers or clients for their input can help you identify what they
                      value most in a solution and what they consider to be less important or unnecessary.
                      This can help you avoid spending time and resources on features that may not be as
                      valuable to the business.

                .strategy-card.h-100

                      i.fas.fa-shield-alt.text-primary.fa-2x.me-3
                      h4.card-title.mb-0 Use Risk Management
                    p.card-text.m-3.
                      By identifying and evaluating potential risks,
                      you can prioritize the most important features and technologies
                      and avoid spending too much time and resources on less important or unnecessary ones.

            p.
              By following these strategies, I can stay focused on delivering solutions that truly benefit the business
              and avoid being sidetracked by sizzle that may not deliver the desired results.

            h2 Focused On Business Success

            blockquote.blockquote.border-start.border-primary.border-4.ps-4.py-3.bg-light.rounded
              p.mb-3.lead.
                "A tech leader's primary objective should be to deliver business success.
                However, it is very common to get sidetracked in the process and lose focus on that goal."

            p.
              Sidetracked leaders can be pulled toward flashy features that do not lead to any
              quantifiable business value.

            p.
              By focusing on measurable business value, leaders can ensure that each feature is delivering results
              that are aligned with the client's overarching objectives. This will help them stay focused on
              business success and minimize the amount of attention given to sizzle that does not deliver value.
              It will also help create a project manager/client relationship built on trust and transparency as well as
              ensure that time and resources are being used efficiently.

            p.
              Therefore, project managers need to have a clear set of goals, understand the measurable business value of any
              features they develop, and prioritize features based on this value. This will help them keep their focus on
              delivering business success and avoid getting sidetracked by flashy features and sizzle.
