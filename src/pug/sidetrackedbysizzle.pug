      h1.mb-0 Sidetracked by sizzle
      .subheading.mb-3 What does sidetracked by sizzle mean?
      p.lead.
        The phrase "Sidetracked by Sizzle" encapsulates those moments when the allure of tech novelties momentarily
        veers us off the path of practicality. It's about being lured by a glossy facade, often at the
        expense of substance. I often add "Not Sidetracked by Sizzle" in my online profiles,
        as a lighthearted testament to my commitment to staying the course,
        valuing the essence over the enticement.
        Much like resisting the urge to buy every new gadget that hits the
        market (looking at you, smart toaster with a built-in weather forecast),
        it's about keeping a keen eye on what truly matters.
        By maintaining a focus on the tangible benefits to the business, it becomes possible
        to deliver more effective and successful solutions.

      .subheading.mb-3  How Can I Recognize When I've Been Sidetracked by Sizzle?
      ul
        li.
          When I find myself more focused on the perceived value of a feature,
          rather than its actual impact on the business, it's a red flag.
          For instance, being enamored by a feature's cutting-edge technology,
          without a clear understanding of how it solves a business problem.
        li.
          When I realize that a significant amount of time and resources have been invested into a feature,
          yet its benefits to the business remain unclear.
        li.
          When I am aiming to impress stakeholders with flashy features,
          rather than addressing their real needs, itâ€™s time to pause.
          This might look like showcasing a high-tech dashboard while core functionality issues remain unresolved.
        li.
          When I discover that my attention is gravitating toward features
          not directly aligned with the business goals or objectives.
        li.
          When I overlook the potential risks or downsides of a feature,
          and stray from a risk management approach in decision-making.
      p.
        When any of these scenarios occur, it's a cue to step back,
        reevaluate the priorities, and refocus on solutions
        that will truly benefit the business and contribute to its success.

          value most in a solution and what they consider to be less important or unnecessary.
          This can help you avoid spending time and resources on features that may not be as
          valuable to the business.
        dt  Use a risk management approach:
        dd.
          By identifying and evaluating potential risks,

        and avoid being sidetracked by sizzle that may not deliver the desired results.

      .subheading.mb-3 Focused On Business Success
      p.
        A tech leader's primary objective should be to deliver business success.
        However, it is very common to get sidetracked in the process and lose focus on that goal.
        Sidetracked leaders can be pulled toward flashy features that do not lead to any
        quantifiable business value.
      p.
        By focusing on measurable business value, leaders can ensure that each feature is delivering results
        that are aligned with the client's overarching objectives. This will help them stay focused on
        business success and minimize the amount of attention given to sizzle that does not deliver value.
        It will also help create a project manager/client relationship built on trust and transparency as well as
        ensure that time and resources are being used efficiently.
      p.
        Therefore, project managers need to have a clear set of goals, understand the measurable business value of any
        features they develop, and prioritize features based on this value. This will help them keep their focus on
        delivery business success and avoid getting sidetracked by flashy features and sizzle.
