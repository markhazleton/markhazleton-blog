          section.mb-5
            p.lead.
              Web Project Mechanics is a web content management system that I have developed and maintained
              for over 20 years. What started as an internally motivated effort to learn new technologies
              and create websites has become a successful and powerful tool for website management.
              Throughout the years, Web Project Mechanics has helped me and my friends with their projects,
              including Project Palette, Reflection Fine Art Gallery, and City Information Centers.

            p.
              This web content management system has been my passion project since its creation in 2003.
              In this article, I'll take you on a journey through the development history of
              Web Project Mechanics, highlighting key milestones and showcasing some of the websites it powers,
              like Frogsfolly.com, DallasInformationCenter.com, and JMShawminerals.com.

            p.
              Twenty years ago, I created my first web content management system and called it Web Project Mechanics.
              I tried several technologies, starting with Front Page and then Java Server Pages (JSP).
              Since then, the system has evolved tremendously, and today it runs on the Microsoft platform, targeting the .NET Framework 4.8.

          // Technology Migration
          section.mb-5
            h2.h3.mb-4.text-primary The Microsoft Platform Migration
            p.
              One of the biggest milestones in the history of Web Project Mechanics was the migration from JSP to the Microsoft platform.
              This allowed me to take advantage of the robust tools and resources offered by the Microsoft ecosystem and enabled me to
              provide a more seamless and efficient experience for my users.

            p.
              Over the years, the code for Web Project Mechanics has been hosted in several different places,
              including file backups, Codeplex, Azure DevOps, and finally, in 2008, on GitHub. The GitHub repository
              has been a crucial part of the system's development and has allowed me to manage the codebase more effectively.

            p.
              If you take a look at the first commit in my GitHub repository in 2008, you can see how far I've come.
              From that first commit to today, I've made countless improvements, added new features, and optimized the
              system for better performance and scalability.

                  p.card-text.
                    In 2003, I created my first web content management system using Java Server Pages (JSP).
                    This was the start of Web Project Mechanics.
                    At that time, I was backing up my code on files, a system that was not ideal, but it worked.
                    Web Project Mechanics was built to manage multiple websites using a single MS-Access (.mdb) database.
                    It was designed to make website management more efficient and user-friendly.

                    In the early days, Web Project Mechanics was built using JSP and backed up on files.
                    This was not an ideal system, but it worked.

                    | 2008: Microsoft Platform Migration
                  p.card-text.
                    In 2008, after years of using JSP, I decided to migrate Web Project Mechanics to the Microsoft platform.
                    This was a major turning point in the development history of the project.
                    The migration allowed me to take advantage of the robust tools and resources offered by the
                    Microsoft ecosystem. It also enabled me to provide a more seamless and efficient experience for my users.
                    This move led to the first commit on GitHub in 2008.

                    Today, Web Project Mechanics is maintained on GitHub and targets the .NET Framework 4.8.
                    The GitHub repository has been crucial in the system's development,
                    allowing me to manage the codebase more effectively, collaborate with others,
                    and ensure the highest quality of code.
                    The current version of Web Project Mechanics includes a caching implementation for better performance.
