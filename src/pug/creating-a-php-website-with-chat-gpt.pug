      .subheading.mb-3  Overcoming the Challenge of Unfamiliar Territory
      p.
        As a Microsoft ASP.NET Solutions Architect,
        my expertise primarily lies in the .NET ecosystem.
        However, I decided to take on a new challenge and explore a completely different programming language - PHP.
        I wanted to see how Chat GPT could assist me in this endeavor.
        Little did I know that this experiment would result in a remarkable journey of discovery.

      dt Saving Conversations as Markdown
      dd.
        Throughout this project, I saved each interaction with Chat GPT as markdown files using a Chrome extension.
        This documentation was crucial in keeping track of the development process and served as
        a valuable resource for future reference.  These became the source files for my markdown library.

      dt Setting the Stage: Building a Basic CMS
      dd.
        My journey began by asking Chat GPT to help me create a basic web content management system (CMS) using PHP.
        This would be the foundation upon which I would build the rest of my project.
        With Chat GPT's guidance, I started creating the core structure of the CMS,
        making sure it could handle various types of content.

      dt Dynamic Page Creation for Markdown Files
      dd.
        Next, I turned to Chat GPT to assist in creating a feature that would allow my CMS to generate pages
        for displaying Markdown files. The challenge was to organize these files, provide smooth navigation,
        and parse Markdown into HTML for proper rendering.
        Chat GPT's insights were invaluable in achieving this functionality.
      dt Empowering Search Functionality
      dd.
        To enhance user experience, I requested Chat GPT to develop a search function that could find
        Markdown documents based on keywords. This feature added a new dimension to my website,
        making it easier for users to discover relevant content swiftly.
      dt Handling CSV Files with Ease
      dd.
        Expanding the capabilities of my PHP website, I tasked Chat GPT with creating a page to list CSV files
        from a folder. The challenge here was not only to list the files but also to display their
        contents along with metadata about the fields in the selected CSV files.
        Chat GPT's assistance made this complex task surprisingly manageable.

      dt Showcasing Projects with JSON
      dd.
        The final piece of the puzzle involved Chat GPT's help in generating a page that would
        create a table from a JSON file listing my projects.
        This table needed to include thumbnails and links to the respective project pages.
        The result was a visually appealing showcase of my work.

      p.
        In the end, I successfully built a PHP website that not only showcased my newfound PHP
        skills but also demonstrated how Chat GPT could elevate my capabilities as a developer.
        This project was a testament to the power of AI in assisting developers in exploring
        new horizons and pushing the boundaries of their expertise.
      p.
        I was able to create a fully functional website with a CMS, search functionality, and dynamic
        page creation for Markdown files, all with the help of Chat GPT.  I published this website
        on an Azure App Service and used Azure DevOps to automate the deployment process.
