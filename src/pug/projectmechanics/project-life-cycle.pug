      .subheading.mb-3 Understanding the Project Life Cycle for Effective Project Management
      p.lead.
        In today's dynamic business environment, effective project management is crucial for organizations to achieve
        their strategic goals and deliver successful outcomes. Understanding the project life cycle and embracing
        project portfolio management (PPM) are essential steps toward ensuring consistency, efficiency,
        and strategic alignment in project execution.
      p.
        The project life cycle provides a structured framework that guides project managers and their teams from the initial idea
        to the final delivery.  By dividing the project into distinct states
        organizations can effectively plan, allocate resources, and track progress at every stage.
        This systematic approach enables objective decision-making, ensures the alignment of projects with strategic objectives,
        and enhances communication and collaboration among stakeholders.

      h2.mb-3 Project Portfolio Management
      p.
        Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is a strategic approach that organizations use to prioritize,
        select, and manage a collection of projects and programs as a unified portfolio.
        It involves aligning projects and programs with the organization's strategic goals and objectives,
        optimizing resource allocation, and balancing the portfolio to maximize value and achieve desired outcomes.
      p.
        PPM provides a structured framework that allows organizations to evaluate and prioritize potential
        projects based on their alignment with strategic objectives, resource availability, risks,
        and expected benefits. By assessing the potential value, risks, and resource requirements of each project,
        PPM helps organizations make informed decisions about which projects to undertake and how to allocate
        resources effectively across the portfolio.
      p.
        A successful PPM program within an organization requires a consistent and structured approach
        for how projects are executed and evaluated.
        Inconsistency in project execution within an organization can lead to confusion,
        inefficiencies, delays, and potential failures.
        Adopting an organization-wide project life cycle becomes imperative to mitigate these risks
        and ensure consistent and effective project management.
      p.
        The Project Life Cycle defines a series of states that a project progresses through from its initiation
        to its completion. It provides a framework for consistent project management, ensuring that projects
        are well-defined, properly planned, and effectively executed.

      h2.mb-3 Benefits of Consistency
      p.
        The Project Life Cycle represents a logical sequence of activities that collectively contribute
        to accomplishing a project's goals or objectives. By dividing a project into distinct states,
        it becomes easier for project managers and their teams to plan, allocate resources,
        and monitor progress effectively.
        Each state within the Project Life Cycle serves a specific purpose and allows for the evaluation
        of project success or failure at key milestones.
      p.
        One of the primary advantages of adopting a common Project Life Cycle within an organization
        is the ability to analyze projects consistently. With a standardized approach, management
        can compare projects, identify patterns, and extract valuable insights.
        By establishing an agreed-upon organizational project lifecycle, management gains a
        a comprehensive view of the entire project portfolio.
        This holistic perspective enables informed decision-making, resource allocation,
        and risk management across projects.
      p.
        A consistent Project Life Cycle facilitates the evaluation of project feasibility,
        alignment with strategic objectives, and resource availability.
        It ensures that projects are properly assessed and justified before significant investments
        of time, effort, and resources are made.
        By adhering to a structured approach, management can prioritize projects,
        allocate resources effectively, and reduce the risk of undertaking projects that lack proper
        justification or strategic fit.
      p.
        A common Project Life Cycle enhances communication and collaboration among project stakeholders
        within the organization.
        By having a shared understanding of the project states and their respective expectations,
        project teams, sponsors, and other key stakeholders can align their efforts, contribute effectively,
        and track progress efficiently. This fosters a collaborative environment where everyone
        is working towards a common goal and ensures that projects move forward smoothly.
      p.
        Implementing a consistent Project Life Cycle within an organization is crucial for
        successful project management and effective project portfolio management.
        By establishing a standardized approach, organizations can better manage their entire portfolio of projects,
        ensuring clear analysis, measurement of success or failure, and informed decision-making.
        A structured approach enables organizations to enhance project outcomes, optimize resource utilization,
        and drive overall business success.
        Consistency in the Project Life Cycle fosters improved project governance, risk management,
        and strategic alignment, leading to greater efficiency, reduced costs, and increased stakeholder satisfaction.

      p.
        The Project Life Cycle defines a series of states that a project goes through from its inception to its completion.
        Project activities are grouped into states so that the project manager and the core team can efficiently plan and organize
        resources appropriately for each state. By planning activities by states the project manager can objectively measure achievement
        of goals and justify their decisions to move ahead, correct, or terminate.
      p.
        It is important to note that not every project will be completed. For example, some projects will not have the
        proper business justification to make it out of the Project Definition state.
      p.
        The Project Life Cycle provides a structured approach to managing projects, ensuring effective planning, execution, and delivery.
        By understanding each state, project managers can navigate through the various milestones, assess progress,
        and make informed decisions.
        From identifying opportunities to project completion or cancellation, following a well-defined project life cycle enhances the chances
        of achieving project objectives efficiently.

          p.
            In this state, an opportunity is identified, signaling the potential for a project.
            However, no specific team has been assigned to define the opportunity yet.
            At this point, the project might exist as an idea or be listed among potential projects.
            The key takeaway is that no work is being done so no resources need to be tracked.

        dt
          h3 Project Definition
        dd
          ul
            li Sponsor has agreed to fund the creation of a project definition.
            li A team has been assigned to define the project and create a proposal.
          p.
            Once a sponsor agrees to fund the project definition, the Project Definition state begins.
            A dedicated team is assigned to define the project and create a proposal.
            During this phase, an accounting code is generated to track the time and resources.
            The deliverable at this state is a comprehensive proposal that outlines the project's goals, scope, timeline, and budget.
            The definition must define how much is it going to cost and what is the benefit to the company.  This is how
            the return on investment is calculated.   The question in this state is "Is it worth it?".
          p.
            This state should not include any design, comps, or documentation other than what is required to propose the work.
            The cost of this state can be allocated to a pursuit budget or a specific project budget.
            If the cost of this state is not billed,
            it still should be tracked to allow for accurate project costing and profitability analysis.

        | Once the project vision has been established, create a list of roles that must be filled.  Review the project’s work breakdown structure and assess the skills required to create the project deliverables.  Do not confuse internal management roles/titles with project delivery skills.  For example, your best facilitator may have the worst technical skills.  If you need to facilitate technical requirements gathering, define a need for a technical architecture role and a facilitator role.  When contacting the staffing group, try to cross-reference the available staff with the required roles.  You may find that some roles require two people.
      p
        | Obtaining the correct staff with the appropriate skills will reduce project anxiety.  It is important to
        em not
        | be afraid to augment staff with another team member possessing a specialized skill (facilitation) for an interim period of time.  The use of specialized staff will not only reduce project anxiety, but also serve to provide a learning experience for the staff.
      h3 Recognize Incentives
      p
        | Project managers should try to identify the possible “wins” for each team member.  If team members are given proper incentive, and they are aware of their personal wins, it will be possible to achieve accelerated change.  It is important to get incentives aligned between clients, consultants, and contractors.
      h3 Allocate Resources
      p
        | Resources are defined as all personnel and things required to achieve the stated project goal.  Failure to secure appropriate resources leads to high frustration levels.  Providing adequate workspace, equipment, and appropriately skilled staff is critical to project success.  Managers should identify any resource shortfalls and create a plan for filling the gaps.  In addition, be sure to communicate this plan to all affected/associated parties.
      h3 Establish Action Plans
      p
        | “Develop a clear plan for action”.  This plan must ensure appropriate timing of resource acquisition in conjunction with the project goals.  A well-defined action plan is essential to communicating the project’s vision to the team members.  The failure to develop an action plan will result in multiple false starts and a loss of efficiency as dependant tasks may wait on preceding task completion.
      h3 Maintain Lines of Communication
      p
        | A critical requirement for obtaining team member buy-in in alignment with client expectations is the clear and concise communication of the project’s vision, team member’s expectations, available resources, and the action plan.  The failure to communicate over the course of a project leads to a damaging divergence of expectations.
      h3 Select a Project “Coach”
      p
        | For all projects at Company, a “Coach” should be identified that will serve as an outside resource providing guidance and direction as required by the Project Manager.  On smaller projects, this relationship will likely be very informal, and the Company Business Unit Leader (BUL) will likely fill the "Coach" role.  As Company grows and project sizes increase, this role will become more formal and experienced resources other than the BUL will likely be called upon.  It is ultimately, however, the responsibility of the Project Manager to identify the Coach for the project.
      p
        | The Coach is intended to be a Company resource that can offer time as required by the Project Manager to discuss issues and aid in keeping the project on track.  The client should be aware of the Coach’s role, and understand that the Coach is part of Company’s process for ensuring project success.  Company does not bill for any time the Coach commits to the project, and Coaches will continue to place their highest priority on their own current project or organizational duties.
      h3 Project Kick-Off Meeting
      p
        | Once an initial project team has been constructed, the Project Manager should hold a project kick-off meeting to discuss the future that lies before the project team and outline critical drivers, objectives, etc… that will be significant to all team members involved.  Below is a list of areas that should be addressed in this kick-off meeting:
      ul(style="list-style-type:circle")
        li Expectations of customer/user/sponsors – Deliverables & "The Journey”
        li Expectations of team members
        li Expectations of Project Manager
        li Project “rules”
        li Resources available
        li Project mechanics (e.g. control procedures, schedules, milestones, etc…)
      p
        | Much like the other initiation tasks in this section, the formality of this meeting will greatly depend on the size and scope of the project.  In any case, it is a critical step in building the team, and empowering the team members.  By drawing the team into the “big picture” from the beginning, the Project Manager will increase buy-in and build the appropriate mechanisms for communication within the project team.
      p
        | As new team members are brought into the project, an informal meeting should be held for the new member in order to minimize the ramp-up time of the team member.

      |  the desired functionality is developed and a compelling proposition for each customer, consumer, and project constituent is produced.
      p
        | Once a project has been planned and the team has been assembled, the next step is to do the work. This is often the most challenging part of project management, as it involves coordinating the efforts of multiple team members, managing resources, and dealing with any issues or challenges that arise. Here are some best practices for doing the work in a project management context:
      ol
        li
          p
            | Communicate regularly: Effective communication is essential for the success of a project. Make sure to communicate regularly with team members and stakeholders, and provide clear and concise updates on the project's progress. This will help to keep everyone informed and on the same page, and it will help to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications.
        li
          p
            | Monitor and track progress: It's important to monitor and track the project's progress regularly, and to make sure that the project is staying on track. This could involve using project tracking software, conducting regular status meetings, or using other tools and techniques to track the project's progress.
        li
          p
            | Manage risks and issues: No project is without risks and issues, and it's important to manage them effectively to keep the project on track. Identify potential risks and issues early, and develop contingency plans to address them. This will help to prevent small issues from becoming major problems.
        li
          p
            | Manage resources: Effective resource management is critical for the success of a project. Make sure that the project has the necessary personnel, equipment, and materials to meet its deadlines, and monitor and manage those resources carefully to prevent any shortages or bottlenecks.
        li
          p
            | Adapt to change: Projects are often dynamic and subject to change, and it's important to be flexible and adaptable in your approach to project management. Be prepared to adjust the project plan as needed to account for changes in the project's scope, timeline, or team.
      p
        | Doing the work in a project management context involves effective communication, progress monitoring, risk and issue management, resource management, and adaptability to change. By following these best practices, project managers can ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time.

      p.
        Effective project management planning involves setting clear, measurable, and achievable objectives
        that can be tracked and monitored throughout the project.
        By setting these objectives, project managers can ensure that the project stays on track,
        that the project's goals are being met, and that any issues or challenges are identified
        and addressed promptly. Here are some best practices
        for setting measurable objective goals in project management planning:
      dl
        dt Identify the project's key objectives
        dd
          p.
            These should be aligned with the project's overall goals and objectives, and they should be specific, measurable, and achievable.
        dt Define specific and measurable goals
        dd
          p.
            These should be quantifiable so that they can be tracked and monitored throughout the project.
            For example, instead of setting a goal to "improve customer satisfaction," set a goal to "increase customer satisfaction by 10%."
        dt Set realistic and achievable goals
        dd
          p.
            It's important to set goals that are realistic and achievable,
            given the project's constraints and resources.
            Avoid setting overly ambitious goals that are unlikely to be met, as this can lead to disappointment and frustration.
            Instead, set goals that are challenging but achievable, and that will provide a sense of accomplishment and progress.
        dt Monitor progress towards the goals
        dd
          p.
            Create a plan for tracking and monitoring progress.
            Once the goals have been set, the next step is to create a plan for tracking and monitoring progress.
            This could involve using project management software, conducting regular status meetings,
            or using other tools and techniques to track and monitor the project's progress.
        dt Adjust the goals as needed
        dd
          p.
            Regularly review and adjust the plan.
            Project management planning is not a one-time activity – it's an ongoing process.
            Regularly review and adjust the plan to account for changes in the project's scope, timeline, or team,
            and make sure that the goals remain relevant and achievable.

      .subheading.mb-3 What is this going to cost?
      p
        | Accurately estimating a project's effort, duration, and cost is one of the most challenging tasks for the Project Manager. At the project start, the Project Manager usually develops macro-level estimates. As the project progresses, the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is refined. A macro-level estimate is used for preliminary planning, creating a global view, and determining project feasibility.
      p
        | I’ve seen people use a flat overhead rate (anywhere between 10-25% depending on what the project sponsor will tolerate) or try to add PM tasks to the project plan to build in hours (meetings(client and team), status reports, issue management, and other activities).  My off-the-cuff answer is 20 percent of the total effort will be related to managing the project and not doing the work. This varies widely depending on the skills of the team, the definition of the work to be done, and the effective change management system

      p
      h2 Some common Estimating Mistakes and how to avoid them:
      p
        strong Expenses
      p
        | Do not forget to include expenses in your estimates.  Use a successful project as a template to make sure that you list everything you will need.  Have someone audit your spreadsheets to ensure that all lines are totaled properly.  A good guide to ensure that you have included all relevant expenses is the Project Initiation Checklist.
      p
        strong Contingency
      p
        | Do not skimp on the contingency estimate.  If you estimate six months plus one month of contingency, quote seven months plus contingency.  The bottom line is nobody is perfect at estimating.  No matter how detailed the estimate, Mr. Murphy will come along to ensure that there are delays and things that were not considered.  The average contingency ranges from 10% on a small project to 30% on larger and riskier projects.
      p
        strong Management Hours/Staff Meetings
      p
        | Management hours and staff meeting hours are often underestimated.  A weekly two-hour meeting by a five-person team constitutes 40 hours per month.  People tend to cut back on these hours because the estimates look high.  If you want a smaller number, break up the meetings into more discrete tasks performed in the meetings.  There is no way to avoid having the meeting if the project is to stay well-managed, so be sure to include the time.
      p
      strong Proficiency Assumptions
      p
      | If you have a team of 15, you can assume that 5-7 of your consultants/associates will be inexperienced.  Estimate them to perform at a 50% proficiency level for the 1
      sup st
      | three months.
      p
      strong Administrative Time
      p
        | Administrative time (i.e. preparing reports, attending meetings, conveying decisions, reviewing surveys, etc…) is often omitted from estimates, yet it is still required.  If a lump sum is inappropriate to show on the WBS, then show the time broken out into discrete tasks.
      p
        strong Supervision Requirements
      p
        | The time required to supervise employees and monitor their development activities is often grossly underestimated.  This underestimation is particularly acute in the early stages of a project where new consultants/associates require a material amount of supervision to keep on track.
      p
        strong Managers Doing "Real Work"
      p
        | As projects grow in size, the job of running a project soon takes nearly full-time management commitment to managerial tasks.  Do not assume that a Manager can be expected to complete deliverables (creating detailed design documents, programming modules, executing test cases, etc.) while managing the project.  Consider the size and scope of the project along with the corresponding management tasks to determine whether a Project Manager will be able to undertake these "real” tasks.  In any case, the assigning of non-management tasks to the Project Manager should be seen as a " red flag"
      p
        strong Resource Sharing
      p
        | Assumptions of sharing do not allow for odd numbers of staff.  Remember to round up to whole numbers.  For example, if there are three resources on an out-of-town project, and one car is allocated for every two staff, two cars will be needed.
      p
        strong Network Access
      p
        | A common area of misestimating is the assumption that the client has the appropriate network in place for development.  Often the client has unreasonable expectations as to how quickly LAN/network hardware and installation can occur.  If the client's staff is supposed to perform the installation work, be sure to develop a contingency plan to account for delays in this area.
      p
      strong Wrong Development Tool
      p
        | Often, the wrong tool is used for the basis of estimation (e.g., the estimate was based upon Visual Basic, and Visual C++ is required).  This situation occurs whenever the requirements are not fully known at the start.  Be sure to include an assumption specifying the need to potentially re-estimate should there be a substantive change in the development tools.
      p
        strong No Tuning Time
      p
        | Be sure to include time for tuning.  Often extensive tuning is required as programs are moved out of development and into testing.
      p
      strong No Transition Time
      p
        | Often, development estimates only include time for personnel to be on-site through testing.  However, it is frequently a requirement that some staff is available to assist the client in the transition to the new production system.  If your estimate does not include transition time, be sure to make a specific exclusion of such assistance in the Job Arrangement Letter.
      p
      strong Documentation
      p
        | The creation of documentation and help text can be very time-consuming.  Even if the actual creation of the documentation and help text is not part of the project deliverables, you will need to include time to assist whoever is responsible for its development.  The client will assume that this "assistance" will be minimal and, therefore, will not require specific time allocated to it.  If the client does have this sentiment, make sure to secure a separate time and materials agreement for all time spent "assisting" in the preparation of documentation for the system.
      p
        strong Assumptions
      p
        | Be sure to document all estimating assumptions specifically listing all exclusions.  Also, be sure to explicitly state those items for which the client is responsible.
