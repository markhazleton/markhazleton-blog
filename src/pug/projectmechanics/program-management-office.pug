        dt Create a plan for tracking and monitoring progress:
        dd Once the goals have been set, the next step is to create a plan for tracking and monitoring progress. This could involve using project management software, conducting regular status meetings, or using other tools and techniques to track and monitor the project&apos;s progress.
        dt Regularly review and adjust the plan:
        dd Project management planning is not a one-time activity &ndash; it&apos;s an ongoing process. Regularly review and adjust the plan to account for changes in the project&apos;s scope, timeline, or team, and make sure that the goals remain relevant and achievable.
        dt Testing Process
        dd
          p During the testing process, manage testing as a continuous activity and generate trusted results.
