      h1 Walking the Tightrope:
      .subheading.mb-3 Finding Balance Between Accountability and Authority
      p.lead.
        Understanding the relationship between accountability and authority is a key skill of leadership.
        Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority and are mindful of the impact of their decisions on others.
        They also understand that with authority comes responsibility, and they are willing to take ownership of the
        outcomes of their actions.  The two concepts are interdependent, and having one without the other can cause
        frustration and lead to negative outcomes.  Effective leaders need to understand the balance between accountability
        and authority to make informed decisions that align with the goals of the organization and the expectations of stakeholders.

      h2 Accountability
      p.
        Accountability is the responsibility for the outcome of a given action. Teams are measured by what was accomplished
        rather than what they could have accomplished. Accountability typically comes from an external person or organization.
        In other words, someone else defines the objectives upon which you will be measured. Accountability implies an obligation
        to account for the defined activities, accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results of these activities transparently.
      p.
        Accountability is a fundamental concept in leadership that refers to the responsibility of an individual or organization
        for their actions and decisions. Accountability implies an obligation to account for the defined activities,
        accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results of these activities transparently. Leaders are often
        held accountable for the outcomes of their decisions and actions, and they are typically granted a certain level of
        authority to make those decisions and take those actions. However, accountability also comes from external sources,
        and someone else defines the objectives upon which leaders will be measured.

      h2 Authority
      p.
        Authority is the ability to perform a given action. This ability can be both formally and informally acquired.
        For instance, the type of authority that is institutionalized in a particular job, function, or position that is
        meant to enable its holder to successfully carry out his or her responsibilities. This includes a right to command
        a situation, commit resources, give orders, and expect them to be obeyed. There is also an implanted authority such
        as a subject matter expert or a long-time member of a team that has much institutional knowledge.
      p.
        Authority refers to the power or right to make decisions and take action. Authority is the ability to perform
        a given action and can be both formally and informally acquired. For example, the type of authority institutionalized
        in a particular job, function, or position is meant to enable its holder to successfully carry out his or her
        responsibilities. It includes the right to command a situation, commit resources, give orders, and expect them
        to be obeyed. There is also an implanted authority, such as a subject matter expert or a long-time member of
        a team that has much institutional knowledge.

      h2 The Relationship between Accountability and Authority
      p.
        Accountability and authority go hand in hand. Having power implies that you will be held accountable for the use of that power.
        Leaders are often held accountable for the outcomes of their decisions and actions, and they are typically granted a certain level of
        authority to make those decisions and take those actions.
      p.
        Accountability without authority can be very frustrating.
        It is hard to implement any meaningful changes that will improve your likelihood of success if you canâ€™t make a decision
        that will be followed.
        Non-management team members often fall into this situation. They are accountable for an objective,
        yet have no direct authority to require a change that they recommend.
      p.
        The opposite situation, authority without accountability, is dangerous and thankfully rare.
        Simply by being in charge, people assume accountability for the performance of a team. Leaders, however, do not.
        They can rapidly become disillusioned and perhaps even bitter if they are not given the authority to do the things
        they will be accountable for. This is especially true if they are held to high standards.
      p.
        Accountability and authority are closely related concepts. Leaders are granted authority to make decisions and take action,
        but with that power comes responsibility.
        Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority and are mindful of the impact of their decisions on others.
        They understand that accountability and authority are interdependent,
        and having one without the other can cause frustration and lead to negative outcomes.
        Accountability without authority can be frustrating, and it is hard to implement meaningful changes
        that will improve success if one cannot make decisions that will be followed.
        Authority without accountability is dangerous and creates a situation where people assume accountability
        for the performance of a team.

      h2 Noblesse Oblige
      p.
        The concept of authority and accountability can be traced back to noblesse oblige,
        a French term that means "nobility obligates." It is the idea that those who have power
        and privilege must use it responsibly for the benefit of others.
        The term is commonly associated with the aristocracy, who had a duty to use their wealth and status to help those less fortunate.
        However, the concept of noblesse oblige extends beyond the aristocracy to anyone in a position of power or privilege.

      h2 Accountability and Authority for Project Leaders
      p.
        Being on a project team gives many people their first real taste of accountability and authority over others.
        Project leaders should be aware of this challenge that their team is facing, and work to provide specific coaching on the topic.
        Try to identify situations where leaders, especially junior leaders, in your organization are held accountable
        for things they cannot control. It creates a very frustrating situation that saps job satisfaction.
        If you are in charge of other leaders, make sure you are clear about your expectations for them.
        This will benefit you while also helping your team. When you grant authority, your subordinate leaders will make decisions.
        Being clear about how you will hold them accountable helps them use that authority effectively.
      p.
        The privilege of authority comes with the burden of accountability.
        It is important to note that authority can be delegated but accountability cannot.
        There will certainly be overlap, but a production manager, for example, cannot make a supervisor solely accountable
        for the performance of an assembly line.
        Never blame a subordinate for something you are accountable for.
      p.
        In conclusion, understanding the relationship between accountability and authority is essential for effective leadership.
        Leaders need to balance the use of their authority with accountability for their actions and decisions.
        Accountability and authority are interdependent concepts, and having one without the other can lead to frustration
        and negative outcomes.
        Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority, are mindful of the impact of their decisions on others,
        and are willing to take ownership of the outcomes of their actions.
        Leaders who embrace the philosophy of "The buck stops here" take responsibility for the consequences
        of their decisions and actions and are more likely to succeed.
