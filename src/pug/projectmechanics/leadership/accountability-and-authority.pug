      .subheading.mb-3 Finding Balance Between Accountability and Authority
      p.lead.
        The terms 'authority' and 'accountability'
        are not merely jargon but pivotal elements that steer a project toward its defined goal.
        Authority is the permission or power granted to individuals, enabling them to make decisions,
        allocate resources, and steer the team in the right direction.
        On the other hand, accountability is the obligation to take responsibility for one's actions and the results thereof.
        The crux of effective management lies in aligning these two aspects seamlessly.
        However, this alignment often presents a suite of challenges that demand astute attention and adept handling.
      p.
        Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority and manage the impact of their decisions on others.
        They also understand that authority comes with responsibility, and they are willing to take ownership of the
        outcomes of their actions.  The two concepts are interdependent, however, having one without the other can cause
        frustration and lead to negative outcomes.  Effective leaders understand the balance between accountability
        and authority to make informed decisions that align with the goals of the organization.

      h2 Accountability
      p.
        Accountability is the responsibility for the outcome of a given action. Teams are measured by what was accomplished
        rather than what they could have accomplished. Accountability typically comes from an external person or organization.
        In other words, someone else defines the objectives upon which you will be measured. Accountability implies an obligation
        to account for the defined activities, accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results of these activities transparently.
      p.
        Accountability is a fundamental concept in leadership that refers to the responsibility of an individual or organization
        for their actions and decisions. Accountability implies an obligation to account for the defined activities,
        accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results of these activities transparently. Leaders are often
        held accountable for the outcomes of their decisions and actions, and they are typically granted a certain level of
        authority to make those decisions and take those actions. However, accountability also comes from external sources,
        and someone else defines the objectives upon which leaders will be measured.

      h2 Authority
      p.
        Authority is the ability to perform a given action. This ability can be both formally and informally acquired.
        For instance, the type of authority that is institutionalized in a particular job, function, or position that is
        meant to enable its holder to successfully carry out his or her responsibilities. This includes a right to command
        a situation, commit resources, give orders, and expect them to be obeyed. There is also an implanted authority such
        as a subject matter expert or a long-time member of a team that has much institutional knowledge.
      p.
        Authority refers to the power or right to make decisions and take action. Authority is the ability to perform

        a team that has much institutional knowledge.

      h2 The Relationship between Accountability and Authority
      p.
        Accountability and authority go hand in hand. Having power implies that you will be held accountable for the use of that power.
        Leaders are often held accountable for the outcomes of their decisions and actions, and they are typically granted a certain level of
        authority to make those decisions and take those actions.
      p.
        Accountability without authority can be very frustrating.
        It is hard to implement any meaningful changes that will improve your likelihood of success if you can’t make a decision
        that will be followed.
        Non-management team members often fall into this situation. They are accountable for an objective,
        yet have no direct authority to require a change that they recommend.
      p.
        The opposite situation, authority without accountability, is dangerous and thankfully rare.
        Simply by being in charge, people assume accountability for the performance of a team. Leaders, however, do not.
        They can rapidly become disillusioned and perhaps even bitter if they are not given the authority to do the things
        they will be accountable for. This is especially true if they are held to high standards.
      p.
        Accountability and authority are closely related concepts. Leaders are granted authority to make decisions and take action,
        but with that power comes responsibility.
        Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority and are mindful of the impact of their decisions on others.
        They understand that accountability and authority are interdependent,
        and having one without the other can cause frustration and lead to negative outcomes.
        Accountability without authority can be frustrating, and it is hard to implement meaningful changes
        that will improve success if one cannot make decisions that will be followed.
        Authority without accountability is dangerous and creates a situation where people assume accountability
        for the performance of a team.

      h2 Noblesse Oblige

      p.
        The concept of <strong>noblesse oblige</strong> is a French term that means "nobility obligates."
        It embodies the idea that individuals with power and privilege are obligated to use their advantages responsibly for the benefit of others.
        This concept isn't limited to the aristocracy; it applies to anyone in a position of power or privilege.

                These examples illustrate how noblesse oblige has encouraged ethical conduct and social responsibility across different eras and sectors.

      p.
        In the context of project leadership, "noblesse oblige" is closely tied to accountability.
        Project leaders, by virtue of their authority, have a responsibility to:
      dl
        dt Use their power responsibly
        dd Make decisions that benefit the team and the project, not just themselves.
        dt Be accountable for their actions and decisions
        dd Take ownership of the outcomes, both positive and negative.
        dt Support their team members
        dd Use their privilege to help team members succeed and ensure they are not held accountable for things outside their control.
      p.
        Project leaders who embrace <strong>noblesse oblige</strong> create a more positive and productive work environment
        where team members feel supported and empowered.
        This, in turn, contributes to greater project success.
      p.
        The concept of authority and accountability can be traced back to noblesse oblige,
        a French term that means "nobility obligates."
        It is the idea that those who have power and privilege must use it responsibly for the benefit of others.
        The term is commonly associated with the aristocracy, who had a duty to use their wealth and status to help those less fortunate.
        However, the concept of noblesse oblige extends beyond the aristocracy to anyone in a position of power or privilege.
      p.
        In modern leadership, noblesse oblige is often seen as a moral framework for those who wield authority.
        Leaders are not merely responsible for achieving results;
        they also have an obligation to uplift their teams, communities, and organizations.
        This principle underscores the idea that privilege—whether it be in the form of wealth,
        position, or knowledge—comes with an inherent duty to contribute positively to society.
        Leaders guided by noblesse oblige view their roles not as opportunities for personal gain, but as platforms for service.
      p.
        One of the most compelling aspects of noblesse oblige is its call to act selflessly,
        even when there is no immediate reward.
        A leader who exemplifies this principle may advocate for their team’s well-being, mentor emerging talent,
        or champion ethical practices, even if these actions require personal sacrifice.
        This sense of obligation fosters trust and loyalty within an organization, as team members feel supported and valued.
        Over time, this dynamic can lead to stronger relationships, higher morale, and better overall performance.
      p.
        The relevance of noblesse oblige extends beyond traditional leadership roles.
        In corporate settings, it can guide executives to prioritize corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives,
        ensuring their organizations have a positive impact on society.
        It can also inspire leaders to embrace inclusivity, recognizing that their position gives
        them the power to advocate for underrepresented voices.
        This proactive use of authority not only aligns with ethical leadership
        but also reinforces the interconnectedness of accountability and authority.
      p.
        Finally, noblesse oblige serves as a counterpoint to authoritarian leadership styles.
        It reminds those in power that their authority is not an entitlement but a privilege that demands accountability.
        When leaders internalize this mindset, they are more likely to approach their roles with humility and
        a focus on collective well-being.
        In this way, noblesse oblige remains a timeless principle, challenging leaders to balance
        their authority with a profound sense of responsibility toward those they serve.

      h2 Accountability and Authority for Project Leaders
      p.
        Being on a project team gives many people their first real taste of accountability and authority over others.
        Project leaders should be aware of this challenge that their team is facing, and work to provide specific coaching on the topic.
        Try to identify situations where leaders, especially junior leaders, in your organization are held accountable
        for things they cannot control. It creates a very frustrating situation that saps job satisfaction.
        If you are in charge of other leaders, make sure you are clear about your expectations for them.
        This will benefit you while also helping your team. When you grant authority, your subordinate leaders will make decisions.
        Being clear about how you will hold them accountable helps them use that authority effectively.
      p.
        The privilege of authority comes with the burden of accountability.
        It is important to note that authority can be delegated but accountability cannot.
        There will certainly be overlap, but a production manager, for example, cannot make a supervisor solely accountable
        for the performance of an assembly line.
        Never blame a subordinate for something you are accountable for.
      p.
        In conclusion, understanding the relationship between accountability and authority is essential for effective leadership.
        Leaders need to balance the use of their authority with accountability for their actions and decisions.
        Accountability and authority are interdependent concepts, and having one without the other can lead to frustration
        and negative outcomes.
        Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority, are mindful of the impact of their decisions on others,
        and are willing to take ownership of the outcomes of their actions.
        Leaders who embrace the philosophy of "The buck stops here" take responsibility for the consequences
        of their decisions and actions and are more likely to succeed.
