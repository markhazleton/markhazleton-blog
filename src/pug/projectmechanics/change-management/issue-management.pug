          p.mb-0 Not every problem is an issue, and not every request is urgent. Effective issue management starts with proper classification and understanding the difference between issues, requests, and risks.

        p.
          Due to the dynamic and fast pace of changes in projects, there is a need for a centralized clearinghouse
          for all issues related to a project. The centralized issue management clearinghouse is used to capture
          and prioritize each issue.
          A common issue log database facilitates open communication between the project management
          and project stakeholders.
          To achieve the maximum benefit from an issue log, a set of procedures should be created to manage issues as they arise.

                  <strong>The Problem:</strong> When everything is marked as "urgent" or "high priority," nothing truly is. This leads to resource thrashing and important issues getting lost in the noise.

                p.
                  <strong>The Solution:</strong> Establish clear, objective criteria for priority levels and stick to them. Regularly review and re-prioritize based on current business context, not initial emotions.

                  strong Rule of Thumb:

                  This is a common challenge that requires diplomatic but firm boundary setting. Start by acknowledging their concern, then redirect to business impact.

                p.
                  <strong>Effective Response:</strong> "I understand this feels urgent to you. Help me understand the business impact if we address this next week versus today. What specific business outcomes are at risk?"

                p.
                  Create a simple impact assessment that forces stakeholders to think through consequences rather than emotions. Most "urgent" requests become "important but not urgent" when examined objectively.
