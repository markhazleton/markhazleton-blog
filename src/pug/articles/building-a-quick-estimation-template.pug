              | I Started with What Made Me Nervous
            
            p.
              I've been in that situation too many times - staring at a list of vague requirements with someone asking for estimates by tomorrow. My first instinct used to be making up numbers that sounded reasonable. But I learned that doesn't help anyone.

            p.
              So I started identifying what actually drove complexity in my work. Not 10 factors, not 20. Just the 3-4 things that genuinely affected effort. I asked myself: what makes me groan when I see it in a requirement? Something completely new to the team? Massive scope? Coordinating multiple teams and skills? Those became my factors.

            p.
              I ditched sophisticated algorithms. What I needed was something I could explain in 30 seconds and calculate in my head. I settled on rating each factor on a 1-10 scale - everyone understands 1-10. Then I tried both adding them and multiplying them.

            p.
              Addition worked better for me when factors felt independent. Multiplication seemed right when factors compounded each other. But I found addition more intuitive and predictable for most situations. I could always adjust with a multiplier later if needed.

            p.
              This is where I found AI assistants really helpful - they can quickly generate the progressive logic. Instead of using one multiplier for everything, I use different multipliers based on the sum:

            p.
              This accounts for the reality that complexity doesn't scale linearly. Small tasks stay small, but complex tasks explode in unexpected ways.

            p.
              I've adapted this framework for different contexts. Working in Agile? I map to Fibonacci. T-shirt sizes? I create bands. Need hours? I use a conversion factor (but I keep it hidden from stakeholders). The beauty is the framework doesn't care about output format - it just generates consistent relative values.

            p.
              The mapping can be a simple lookup table or nested IF statements. I let Claude write these for me - it's great at generating these tedious but necessary formulas.

            p When I had even 5-10 completed items, I worked backwards:

            ol
              li Take a completed item
              li Rate it with your Innovation, Scope, and People factors
              li Calculate what multiplier would have given you the actual result
              li Average across several items
              li That's your team's multiplier

              No history? Start with a multiplier of 3 and adjust after your first few completions. The exact number matters less than having a consistent method.

            p.
              My goal isn't perfect estimates - it's estimates I can explain and adjust. When someone challenges my numbers, I can show:

              li The specific Innovation, Scope, and People ratings
              li Why you rated each factor that way

              li Which completed work validates your approach

              Add a column for "actual effort" and calculate variance automatically. Add conditional formatting to highlight when estimates are off by more than 50%. This isn't about shame - it's about continuous calibration.

            p.
              Track patterns: Are innovative tasks always underestimated? Does your team consistently underrate the People complexity? These patterns help you adjust ratings going forward, not just multipliers.

              If you're spending more than 2 minutes per estimate, your framework is too complex. The power isn't in sophistication - it's in consistency and speed. You should be able to estimate 50 items in under an hour.

            p This means:
            ul
              li Clear definitions for Innovation (have we done this?), Scope (how big?), and People (how many skills/teams?)
              li Reference examples for common patterns

              Your first version will be wrong. That's fine. The framework gives you something to be wrong WITH, which is infinitely better than being wrong without any structure.

            p After each sprint/milestone/project:
            ol
              li Compare estimates to actuals
              li Look for systematic bias in Innovation, Scope, or People ratings

              Having a framework - any framework - changes the conversation from "how did you guess that?" to "let's discuss these ratings." It moves you from defending random numbers to discussing specific complexity factors.

            p.
              This is huge. Stakeholders can engage with "I rated People complexity as 7 because we need frontend, backend, DBA, and DevOps coordination" in a way they can't with "my gut says 3 weeks."

                p You estimated a task:
                ul.mb-2
                  li Innovation: 4, Scope: 5, People: 3
                  li Sum: 12, Multiplier: 3, Estimate: 36 → 34 points
                p It actually took 55 points.
                p.mb-0
                  | <strong>Implied multiplier:</strong> 55÷12 = 4.6

            The perfect estimation framework doesn't exist, and this certainly isn't it. But I've found that having a simple, transparent, adjustable approach beats guessing every time. I built mine quickly with AI help, implemented it immediately, and I keep refining it with every project.

          p.mb-4.
            Here's what surprised me: I don't need much information to start estimating systematically. I just need a consistent way to capture what little I know. My three factors - Innovation (have we done this?), Scope (how big?), and People (who's involved?) - plus simple math and regular calibration have gotten me surprisingly far. Your mileage may vary, but this approach works for me.

                <strong>(Innovation + Scope + People) × Multiplier = Estimate</strong>

          p.mb-4.
            When someone asks how I estimated 50 items so quickly, I show them my spreadsheet and explain that I rate how new it is to our team, how big it is, and how many people/skills are involved. Usually they nod along. That's when I know this approach might work for them too.

          p.mb-0.
            <strong>One last thing:</strong> My goal isn't to predict the future perfectly. It's to be consistently wrong in a way I can measure and correct. I've found that's infinitely more valuable than random guessing, and it gets better every time I use it. Maybe it'll work for you too.
