              | The 4 PM Estimation Crisis
            
            p.
              Last month, my PM dropped 73 backlog items on my desk at 4 PM. "Need estimates by tomorrow's planning meeting." Sound familiar?

            p.
              Here's what I did: I grabbed the scariest item—a machine learning integration nobody on the team had touched before. I rated it:

            ul.mb-3
              li <strong>Innovation: 8</strong> (we've never done ML)
              li <strong>Scope: 7</strong> (new infrastructure, data pipelines, APIs)
              li <strong>People: 7</strong> (data scientists, backend devs, DevOps, plus external vendors)

            p.
              That's 22 points. With my multiplier of 5 for high complexity, I got 110 → mapped to 89 story points.

            p.
              Took me 90 seconds. By 6 PM, I'd estimated all 73 items. Here's the framework I built and how you can adapt it for your team.

            p.
              I ditched sophisticated algorithms. What I needed was something I could explain in 30 seconds and calculate in my head. I settled on rating each factor on a 1-10 scale - everyone understands 1-10.

            p.
              Addition worked better than multiplication. It's intuitive, predictable, and gives a manageable range (3-30 instead of 1-1000). I can always adjust with a multiplier later based on complexity.

            p.
              Why not use a flat 3× multiplier across the board? Because complexity doesn't scale linearly.

            p.
              A simple bug fix (sum of 5) might take 10 hours—double the base complexity. But a massive integration (sum of 22) doesn't take 44 hours. It explodes to 110+ hours because of:

            ul.mb-3
              li Context switching overhead between systems
              li Integration testing across multiple platforms
              li More stakeholders = more delays and approval cycles
              li Unknown unknowns multiply with complexity
              li Communication overhead grows exponentially

            p.
              I arrived at these specific multipliers by analyzing 50 completed projects and calculating implied multipliers. Here's what the data showed:

                  Anything above sum of 20 showed wildly unpredictable multipliers (5.8× to 7.2×). Those tasks were consistently underestimated and should have been broken down. That's why 21+ is a red flag in my framework.

            p.
              Then came the "simple" mobile app redesign. I rated it:

            ul.mb-3
              li <strong>Innovation: 3</strong> (we'd done mobile before)
              li <strong>Scope: 5</strong> (just UI changes)

              The goal isn't perfect estimates—it's estimates you can explain and adjust. When someone challenges your numbers, you can show:

              Having a framework changes the conversation from "how did you guess that?" to "let's discuss these ratings." It moves you from defending random numbers to discussing specific complexity factors.

            p.
              Stakeholders can engage with "I rated People complexity as 7 because we need frontend, backend, DBA, and DevOps coordination" in a way they can't with "my gut says 3 weeks."

                  Be upfront that this is a rapid estimation tool based on simple math. Don't pretend it's more sophisticated than it is. When presenting estimates, show the Innovation + Scope + People ratings openly and explain it takes 30 seconds per item. Honesty builds credibility.

                           QUICK ESTIMATION FRAMEWORK
                ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

                STEP 1: Rate Each Factor (1-10)
                ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  Innovation: Have WE done this?
                    1-3 = Many times (templates exist)
                    4-6 = Similar work (need adaptation)
                    7-10 = Never attempted (R&D required)

                  Scope: How big is it?
                    1-3 = Small (one component)
                    4-6 = Medium (multiple components)
                    7-10 = Massive (system-wide changes)

                  People: Coordination complexity?
                    1-3 = Solo or single team
                    4-6 = 2-3 teams, some handoffs
                    7-10 = Many teams, diverse skills

                STEP 2: Add Them Up
                ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  Sum = Innovation + Scope + People

                STEP 3: Apply Multiplier Based on Sum
                ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  Sum 3-9:    × 2.5   (Low complexity)
                  Sum 10-15:  × 4     (Medium complexity)
                  Sum 16-20:  × 5     (High complexity)
                  Sum 21+:    × 6     (Flag for splitting!)

                STEP 4: Map to Your Format
                ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  Fibonacci:  3-6→3, 7-10→5, 11-14→8, 15-18→13, 19-22→21
                  T-Shirt:    3-6→XS, 7-9→S, 10-13→M, 14-17→L, 18+→XL

                RED FLAGS
                ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  ⚠ Sum over 20? Split the task
                  ⚠ Actual 2× estimate? Check which factor you underrated
                  ⚠ Consistently off? Adjust your multiplier

                CALIBRATION
                ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  Implied Multiplier = Actual Effort ÷ (I + S + P)
                  Average across 5-10 tasks → Your team's multiplier

                EXAMPLE
                ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  ML Integration: I=8, S=7, P=7
                  Sum = 22, Multiplier = 5
                  Raw = 110 → Maps to 89 story points

            The perfect estimation framework doesn't exist. But having a simple, transparent, adjustable approach beats guessing every time. I built mine with AI help, implemented it immediately, and keep refining it with every project.

          p.mb-4.
            Here's what surprised me: You don't need much information to start estimating systematically. You just need a consistent way to capture what little you know. Three factors—Innovation (have we done this?), Scope (how big?), and People (who's involved?)—plus simple math and regular calibration have gotten me far.

              p.lead.text-center.mb-0.
                <strong>(Innovation + Scope + People) × Multiplier = Estimate</strong>

          p.mb-4.
            When someone asks how I estimated 50 items so quickly, I show them the spreadsheet and explain the three factors. Usually they nod along. That's when I know this approach might work for them too.

          p.mb-0.
            <strong>Remember:</strong> The goal isn't to predict the future perfectly. It's to be consistently wrong in a way you can measure and correct. That's infinitely more valuable than random guessing, and it gets better every time you use it.
