              | The 4 PM Estimation Crisis
            
            p.
              Last month, my PM dropped 73 backlog items on my desk at 4 PM. "Need estimates by tomorrow's planning meeting." Sound familiar?

            p.
              Here's what I did: I grabbed the scariest item—a machine learning integration nobody on the team had touched before. I rated it:

            ul.mb-3
              li <strong>Innovation: 8</strong> (we've never done ML)
              li <strong>Scope: 7</strong> (new infrastructure, data pipelines, APIs)
              li <strong>People: 7</strong> (data scientists, backend devs, DevOps, plus external vendors)

            p.
              That's 22 points. With my multiplier of 5 for high complexity, I got 110 → mapped to 89 story points.

            p.
              Took me 90 seconds. By 6 PM, I'd estimated all 73 items. Here's the framework I built and how you can adapt it for your team.

            p.
              I needed something simple: rate each factor on a 1-10 scale, add them up, apply a multiplier. That's it.

            p.
              Addition gives a manageable range (3-30) vs. multiplication (1-1000). I can explain it in 30 seconds and calculate it in my head.

              Complexity doesn't scale linearly. A sum of 5 might double in effort, but a sum of 22 explodes due to context switching, integration testing, stakeholder delays, and communication overhead.

              The framework generates consistent relative values that map to any output format. Working in Agile? Map to Fibonacci. T-shirt sizes? Create bands. Need hours? Use a conversion factor (but keep it hidden from stakeholders).

            p.
              The mapping can be a simple lookup table or nested IF statements. Let AI write these tedious formulas for you.

              After six months of 10% accuracy, I got cocky. A "simple" mobile redesign: Innovation 3 (done mobile before), Scope 5 (just UI), People 2 (one team). Sum of 10, ×4 multiplier = 40 hours.

            The perfect estimation framework doesn't exist. But having a simple, transparent, adjustable approach beats guessing every time. I built mine with AI help, implemented it immediately, and keep refining it with every project.

          p.mb-4.
            Here's what surprised me: You don't need much information to start estimating systematically. You just need a consistent way to capture what little you know. Three factors, simple math, and regular calibration have gotten me far.

            <strong>(Innovation + Scope + People) × Multiplier = Estimate</strong>

          p.
            <strong>Remember:</strong> The goal isn't to predict the future perfectly. It's to be consistently wrong in a way you can measure and correct.


            
            ul.mb-4
              li <strong>Overcomplicating factors:</strong> Don't split Innovation into subcategories. Keep it simple.
              li <strong>Confusing Scope with People:</strong> A large migration (Scope 8) might only need one DBA (People 2).
              li <strong>Rating by industry standards:</strong> Innovation means "have WE done this?"—not whether it exists.
              li <strong>Using multiplication:</strong> Innovation × Scope × People gives 1-1000. Addition gives 3-30 (much better).
              li <strong>Ignoring skill diversity:</strong> Three backend devs = low People. Backend + frontend + DBA = high People.
