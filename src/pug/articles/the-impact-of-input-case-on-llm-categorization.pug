          .lead.mb-4
            | Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks,
            | including text categorization. However, the seemingly minor detail of input case can significantly influence how these models process information,
            | leading to variations in tokenization and, consequently, the categories they return.
            | Understanding this sensitivity is crucial for developing robust and reliable categorization agents.

      .lead.mb-4
        | At the core of how LLMs understand text lies tokenization,
        | the process of breaking down raw text into smaller units called tokens.
        | Tokenization, the process of breaking text into tokens, is profoundly impacted by input case.
        | Case-sensitive tokenizers treat "Apple" and "apple" as distinct,
        | while case-insensitive tokenizers merge them, affecting downstream tasks.
        | The way an LLM's tokenizer handles case sensitivity plays a pivotal role in shaping the input it ultimately processes.

                | Many LLMs utilize case-sensitive tokenizers,
                | where uppercase and lowercase forms of a word are treated as distinct tokens.
                | For instance, in a case-sensitive model, "Apple" and "apple" would be assigned different token IDs and embedding vectors.
                | This distinction allows the model to potentially capture nuances associated with capitalization, such as proper nouns or emphasis.

                | Some approaches employ case-insensitive tokenization,

                | In such systems, "Apple" and "apple" would be treated as identical tokens.
                | While this simplifies the vocabulary and can aid generalization in some tasks,
                | it also means the loss of any information conveyed through capitalization.

            p.mb-0
              | Subword tokenizers like BERT's WordPiece can split "AIRPORT" into fragments (e.g., "AI", "##R"),
              | complicating categorization compared to "airport" as a single token.
              | The choice of tokenization directly dictates the sequence of tokens the LLM receives as input.
              | Therefore, altering the case in the input can fundamentally change the representation the model uses for categorization.

      p.
        Furthermore, case changes can affect how subword tokenizers split words.
        For example, a word like "airport" might be a single token for BERT's WordPiece tokenizer.
        However, if the input is "AIRPORT" (all caps), it could be broken down into multiple subword fragments
        like "AI", "##R", "##PO", "##RT". This fragmentation of all-caps words into "nonsense" subword pieces can
        complicate the model's understanding and potentially lead to different categorization outcomes

        Ideally, a categorization agent should be robust to variations in user input case,
        including titles in all caps or random capitalization.
        If a model was primarily trained on well-cased text, it might misinterpret oddly cased input.
        Strategies to address this include data augmentation with mixed-case examples during training.
        For critical applications, it might be necessary to experiment with both case-sensitive and case-insensitive preprocessing
        or even use additional features to explicitly capture information lost through normalization.

            .accordion-body
              p A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models use deep learning techniques, particularly transformer architectures, to capture complex patterns and relationships in language, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and text generation.
              p LLMs have revolutionized the field of natural language processing by achieving state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks. Their ability to generalize from massive datasets allows them to handle nuanced language tasks, but they also require significant computational resources for training and inference. See more on

          .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseTokenization
            .accordion-body
              p Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens, which are the basic building blocks for language models. Tokens can be words, subwords, or even individual characters, depending on the tokenizer's design and the language being processed.
              p Effective tokenization is crucial for language models because it determines how text is represented and understood by the model. The choice of tokenization method can impact model performance, vocabulary size, and the ability to handle rare or unknown words. See more on

            .accordion-body
              p BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based language model developed by Google that introduced bidirectional context into language modeling. Unlike previous models that read text sequentially, BERT reads text in both directions, allowing it to better understand the context of each word.
              p BERT has set new standards in NLP by achieving top performance on a variety of tasks, including question answering and named entity recognition. Its architecture has inspired many subsequent models and is widely used in both research and industry. See more on
