      h2.mb-3 Tokenization: The First Hurdle Influenced by Case
      p.
        At the core of how LLMs understand text lies tokenization,
        the process of breaking down raw text into smaller units called tokens.
        Tokenization, the process of breaking text into tokens, is profoundly impacted by input case.
        Case-sensitive tokenizers treat "Apple" and "apple" as distinct,
        while case-insensitive tokenizers merge them, affecting downstream tasks.
        The way an LLM's tokenizer handles case sensitivity plays a pivotal role in shaping the input it ultimately processes.

            .card-body
              p.card-text.
                Many LLMs utilize case-sensitive tokenizers,
                where uppercase and lowercase forms of a word are treated as distinct tokens.
                For instance, in a case-sensitive model, “Apple” and “apple” would be assigned different token IDs and embedding vectors.
                This distinction allows the model to potentially capture nuances associated with capitalization, such as proper nouns or emphasis

            .card-body
              p.card-text.
                Some approaches employ case-insensitive tokenization,
                typically by converting all input text to lowercase before tokenization.
                In such systems, "Apple" and "apple" would be treated as identical tokens.
                While this simplifies the vocabulary and can aid generalization in some tasks,
                it also means the loss of any information conveyed through capitalization

      p.
        Subword tokenizers like BERT's WordPiece can split "AIRPORT" into fragments (e.g., "AI", "##R"),
        complicating categorization compared to "airport" as a single token.
        The choice of tokenization directly dictates the sequence of tokens the LLM receives as input.
        Therefore, altering the case in the input can fundamentally change the representation the model uses for categorization.
        Furthermore, case changes can affect how subword tokenizers split words.
        For example, a word like “airport” might be a single token for BERT’s WordPiece tokenizer.
        However, if the input is “AIRPORT” (all caps), it could be broken down into multiple subword fragments
        like "AI", "##R", "##PO", "##RT". This fragmentation of all-caps words into "nonsense" subword pieces can
        complicate the model's understanding and potentially lead to different categorization outcomes

      h2.mb-3 How Tokenization Changes Impact Categorization
      p.
        Tokenization changes ripple through LLM layers, altering internal representations and leading to different classification outputs.
        Models may activate different learned patterns based on input case.
        Since tokenization is the initial step in processing text for an LLM,
        any changes at this stage propagate through the model's layers,
        ultimately influencing the categorization output.
        If the input case alters the tokens, the model's internal representation of the text will be different.
        This means the model might activate different patterns and associations learned during its training,
        potentially leading to different classification decisions

      h2.mb-3 Case Sensitivity Across Different LLM Architectures
      p.
        Case sensitivity varies across models like BERT, GPT, and others:

            .accordion-body
              p.
                <strong>BERT-base-cased</strong> preserves capitalization, aiding tasks like NER, while <strong>BERT-base-uncased</strong>
                generalizes better by ignoring case.
                The uncased version was trained on lowercased text, making it inherently case-insensitive.
                In contrast, the cased version preserves the original casing and can leverage capitalization cues.
                This design choice leads to performance differences on various tasks.
                For instance, <strong>BERT-base-cased</strong> might perform better on Named Entity Recognition where capitalization is crucial,
                while <strong>BERT-base-uncased</strong> might generalize better for topic classification where the underlying meaning is less dependent on case.

              p.
                GPT models (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3) use case-sensitive BPE tokenization, yet show robustness to noisy input due to their training data scale.
                Models in the GPT family utilize byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization without lowercasing,
                making them inherently case-sensitive. They assign different token IDs even for the same word with different
                casing (e.g., "Hello" vs. "hello").
                Despite this sensitivity, research suggests that decoder-only LLMs like GPT-2 can be relatively robust to noisy case changes,
                potentially due to their extensive training data and byte-level BPE handling variations smoothly

              p.
                Many modern Transformers (RoBERTa, XLNet, T5) retain case information by default, impacting their categorization behaviors depending on the task.
                They typically retain case by default through subword tokenization or byte encodings.
                However, older models or those explicitly trained with case normalization (like some LSTM-based classifiers) will be case-insensitive.

              p.card-text.
                Casing enhances sentiment detection by preserving cues like all-caps emphasis (e.g., "AMAZING!").
                While the core sentiment often resides in the words themselves,
                casing can carry subtle sentiment cues. For example, all-caps words like "AMAZING!" can indicate intensified emotion.
                Lowercasing everything would lose this emphasis.
                Some sentiment analysis systems even explicitly boost sentiment intensity for all-caps words.
                Therefore, preserving case might be beneficial for sentiment classifiers to capture these nuances.
                However, one must also be aware that uncommon all-caps words might be split into subwords, which the model then needs to interpret.

              h3.card-title Topic Classification
              p.card-text.
                Case sensitivity helps identify acronyms and proper nouns ("WHO" vs. "who"), critical in topic categorization.
                Historically, making models case-insensitive was often considered acceptable, or even helpful, for topic classification,
                as the difference between "inflation" and "Inflation" is usually insignificant for determining the topic.
                Lowercasing can reduce data sparsity (treating "NASA" and "nasa" as the same).
                However, case can be crucial for identifying domain-specific terms, acronyms,
                and proper nouns that are strong indicators of a topic (e.g., "COVID-19", "UNICEF", "Python" vs. "python").
                A case-sensitive model can differentiate between "who" (a pronoun) and "WHO" (World Health Organization).
                Modern transformer models used for topic classification generally retain case and perform well

      h2.mb-3 Ensuring Robustness to Varying Input Case
      p.
        For robust agents, employ data augmentation with mixed-case samples.
        Experiment with both cased and uncased preprocessing depending on task needs.
        Ideally, a categorization agent should be robust to variations in user input case,
        including titles in all caps or random capitalization.
        If a model was primarily trained on well-cased text, it might misinterpret oddly cased input.
        Strategies to address this include data augmentation with mixed-case examples during training.
        For critical applications, it might be necessary to experiment with both case-sensitive and case-insensitive preprocessing
        or even use additional features to explicitly capture information lost through normalization.
      h2.mb-3 Conclusion
      p.
        Input case significantly impacts LLM categorization agents by influencing the tokenization process.
        Case-sensitive tokenization preserves potential nuances but can lead to different tokens for the same word with different casing,
        potentially altering the model's internal representation and categorization output.
        Different LLM architectures exhibit varying degrees of case sensitivity based on their tokenizers and training.
        The importance of preserving case depends on the specific categorization task;
        it can be beneficial for capturing sentiment intensity and distinguishing topic-defining acronyms and proper nouns,
        but might be less critical for general topic identification.
      p.
        Ultimately, understanding your model's tokenizer, the role of case in your specific categorization task,
        and experimenting with different preprocessing approaches are key to building reliable
        and robust LLM-based categorization agents. Evaluating your model's performance with both original-cased
        and lowercased input can reveal its sensitivity to case changes and guide you in making informed decisions about text preprocessing
