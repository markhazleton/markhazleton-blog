        dt Introduction
        dd
          p.
            The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in structuring and managing data has been increasingly pivotal across various sectors.
            With the introduction of advanced tools like OpenAI's JSON mode, the functionality and reliability of these AI systems,
            particularly in structuring data into JSON formats, have seen significant improvements.
          p.
            Large language models (LLM) are revolutionizing how we build appliations.
            The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in processing and structuring data
            has become a transformative force across various industries.
            LLMs like GPT-4 are at the forefront of this innovation,
            offering capabilities that extend far beyond simple text generation.
        dt Understanding Large Language Models
        dd
          p.
            Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on diverse datasets to understand and generate human-like text.
            LLMs like GPT-4 have been designed to comprehend and generate text
            that mimics human-like understanding, which can be particularly useful in transforming
            unstructured data into structured formats such as JSON.
        dt Why Structured Data Matters
        dd
          p.
            JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write,
            and easy for machines to parse and generate.
            JSON is an ideal format for data management due to its lightweight
            and easy-to-parse nature, which is essential for web applications like Mechanics of Motherhood to efficiently manage recipe data.
          p.
            Structured data is organized and tagged with accurate metadata,
            making it easier for machines to understand, process, and "read" the information efficiently.

        dt OpenAI's JSON Mode
        dd
          p.
            Recently, OpenAI introduced a specific feature known as "JSON mode" in its API
            offerings (such as gpt-4-turbo-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125),
            which forces the model to generate outputs that are valid JSON objects.
            This development is particularly useful in scenarios where data integrity and format validity are paramount.
          p.
            When enabled, JSON mode constrains the AI model to produce only strings that parse into valid JSON objects.
            This feature is crucial for applications that require reliable data formatting
            without errors commonly associated with manual parsing.

        dt Mechanics of Motherhood: A Website for Mothers
        dd
          p Mechanics of Motherhood is a website that offers a vast array of mother-approved recipes aimed at simplifying meal preparation for busy parents.
          p.
            Mechanics of Motherhood is dedicated to offering real-world perspectives on the challenges and triumphs of being a working mother.
            Recognizing that motherhood is a full-time job, the site provides resources to simplify mealtime with quick, affordable,
            and kid-friendly recipes designed to reduce stress and increase family time.
          p.
            In addition to recipes, the site features a blog sharing personal stories, insights, and tips from a mother's perspective.
        dt From Recipe to JSON: Using AI to Generate Structured Data
        dd
          p.
           The first step involves gathering the recipe content, which could be in various formats such as text files, emails, or even scanned documents.
           The user can just prompt the AI model with the recipe  details and let the LLM generate the JSON string for the recipe.
          p The input is used to create a call to the AI model, which processes the information and generates a structured JSON string.
          p The JSON string includes key recipe details such as name, description, category, servings, ingredients, and instructions.
