          dt Introduction
          dd
            p.
              The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in structuring and managing data has been increasingly pivotal across various sectors.
              With the introduction of advanced tools like OpenAI's JSON mode, the functionality and reliability of these AI systems,
              particularly in structuring data into JSON formats, have seen significant improvements.
            p.
              Large language models (LLM) are revolutionizing how we build appliations.
              The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in processing and structuring data
              has become a transformative force across various industries.
              LLMs like GPT-4 are at the forefront of this innovation,
              offering capabilities that extend far beyond simple text generation.
          dt Understanding Large Language Models
          dd
            p.
              Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on diverse datasets to understand and generate human-like text.
              LLMs like GPT-4 have been designed to comprehend and generate text
              that mimics human-like understanding, which can be particularly useful in transforming
              unstructured data into structured formats such as JSON.
          dt Why Structured Data Matters
          dd
            p.
              JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write,
              and easy for machines to parse and generate.
              JSON is an ideal format for data management due to its lightweight
              and easy-to-parse nature, which is essential for web applications like Mechanics of Motherhood to efficiently manage recipe data.
            p.
              Structured data is organized and tagged with accurate metadata,
              making it easier for machines to understand, process, and "read" the information efficiently.

          dt OpenAI's JSON Mode
          dd
            p.
              Recently, OpenAI introduced a specific feature known as "JSON mode" in its API
              offerings (such as gpt-4-turbo-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125),
              which forces the model to generate outputs that are valid JSON objects.
              This development is particularly useful in scenarios where data integrity and format validity are paramount.
            p.
              When enabled, JSON mode constrains the AI model to produce only strings that parse into valid JSON objects.
              This feature is crucial for applications that require reliable data formatting
              without errors commonly associated with manual parsing.

          dt Mechanics of Motherhood: A Website for Mothers
          dd

          dt From Recipe to JSON: Using AI to Generate Structured Data
          dd
            p.
              The first step involves gathering the recipe content, which could be in various formats such as text files, emails, or even scanned documents.
              The user can just prompt the AI model with the recipe  details and let the LLM generate the JSON string for the recipe.
            p The input is used to create a call to the AI model, which processes the information and generates a structured JSON string.
            p The JSON string includes key recipe details such as name, description, category, servings, ingredients, and instructions.
