        dt Introduction
        dd
          p.
            The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in structuring and managing data has been increasingly pivotal across various sectors.
            With the introduction of advanced tools like OpenAI's JSON mode, the functionality and reliability of these AI systems,
            particularly in structuring data into JSON formats, have seen significant improvements.
          p.
            Large language models (LLM) are revolutionizing how we build appliations.
            The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in processing and structuring data
            has become a transformative force across various industries.
            LLMs like GPT-4 are at the forefront of this innovation,
            offering capabilities that extend far beyond simple text generation.

          h3 Understanding Large Language Models
          p.
            Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on diverse datasets to understand and generate human-like text.
            LLMs like GPT-4 have been designed to comprehend and generate text
            that mimics human-like understanding, which can be particularly useful in transforming
            unstructured data into structured formats such as JSON.
          h3 Why Structured Data Matters
          p.
            JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write,
            and easy for machines to parse and generate.
            JSON is critical for data management due to its lightweight
            and easy-to-parse nature, which is essential for web applications like Mechanics of Motherhood to efficiently manage recipe data.
          p.
            Structured data is organized and tagged with accurate metadata,
            making it easier for machines to understand, process, and "read" the information efficiently.
          h3 OpenAI's JSON Mode: A New Development
          p.
            Recently, OpenAI introduced a specific feature known as "JSON mode" in its API
            offerings (such as gpt-4-turbo-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125),
            which forces the model to generate outputs that are valid JSON objects.
            This development is particularly useful in scenarios where data integrity and format validity are paramount.
          p.
            When enabled, JSON mode constrains the AI model to produce only strings that parse into valid JSON objects.
            This feature is crucial for applications that require reliable data formatting
            without errors commonly associated with manual parsing.

        dt From Recipe to JSON
        dd
          h2 Using AI to Generate Structured Data
          p The first step involves gathering the recipe content, which could be in various formats such as text files, emails, or even scanned documents.
          p The user can just prompt the AI model with the recipe  details and let the LLM generate the JSON string for the recipe.
          p The input is used to create a call to the AI model, which processes the information and generates a structured JSON string.
          p The JSON string includes key recipe details such as name, description, category, servings, ingredients, and instructions.
          p The structured JSON string is then imported into the Mechanics of Motherhood database, where it is displayed on the website for users to access.

        dd
          h2 Efficiency and Accuracy
          p AI dramatically speeds up the process of data entry and reduces human errors, ensuring that the recipes are accurate and uniformly formatted.
          h2 Search Engine Optemization (SEO)
          p Structured data is essential for SEO, as it helps search engines understand the content of a webpage better, leading to improved visibility and ranking.
          p The LLM-generated JSON strings are optimized for SEO, ensuring that the recipes are easily discoverable by search engines.

        dt Leveraging OpenAI's JSON Mode
