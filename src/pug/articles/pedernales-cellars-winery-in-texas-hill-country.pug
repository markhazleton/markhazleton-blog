      h1 Pedernales Cellars: History, Winemaking Philosophy, and Sustainable Practices
      h2.subheading.mb-3 Family-Run Texas Winery Celebrated for Sustainability and Mediterranean-Style Wines
      p
        | Located in Stonewall, Texas,
        a(href='https://www.pedernalescellars.com/', target='_blank') Pedernales Cellars
        | is known for crafting award-winning Spanish and Rhône-style wines from 100% Texas-grown grapes.
        | Run by sixth-generation Texans, the winery blends traditional values with modern environmental responsibility.

      h2 History and Founding
      p.
        Pedernales Cellars traces its origin to the early 1990s, when Larry and Jeanine Kuhlken planted the family's first vineyard near Fredericksburg
        in the Texas Hill Country. At that time, Texas winemaking was still nascent, and the Kuhlken family joined other local pioneers
        in experimenting with grape varieties and viticultural practices suitable for the Texas terroir.
        Their vineyard, located in the Bell Mountain AVA (the first designated American Viticultural Area in Texas),
        gradually yielded high-quality fruit with bold flavors as the family honed which grapes thrived in the region's climate and soil.
        Over time, the family identified optimal varietals for the region, founding Pedernales Cellars in 2006.
      p.
        In 2006, the Kuhlken's children - David (a Rice-educated winemaker) and Julie (a former philosophy professor)
        - founded Pedernales Cellars as a boutique winery built on the success of the estate Kuhlken Vineyards.
        The sibling duo envisioned crafting handcrafted, small-lot wines from varietals that flourish in the rugged Hill Country environment.
        Pedernales Cellars remains a true family enterprise: David has served as head winemaker since the winery's inception,
        while Julie oversees operations, marketing and hospitality. Even the third generation of the family has been involved,
        apprenticing in vineyard and cellar tasks to carry on the legacy.
        The winery's name “Pedernales” itself honors local heritage - the Pedernales River that winds through the Hill Country,
        and the Spanish word pedernales meaning “flint.”
        The discovery of flint arrowheads and tools on their property inspired this name,
        symbolically linking their wine site to the region's ancient history.
