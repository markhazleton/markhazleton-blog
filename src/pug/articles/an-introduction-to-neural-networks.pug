      h3 What is a Neural Network?
      p.mb-3.
        Neural networks are powerful computational models inspired by the structure
        and function of the human brain.
        These models are designed to recognize patterns, solve problems, and make predictions.
        They are composed of interconnected nodes (or neurons) organized into layers.

      h4 Components of a Neural Network:
      p.mb-3.
        Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes, often referred to as neurons or units,
        arranged in layers. Each neuron mimics the behavior of a biological neuron by taking inputs,
        applying weights and biases, processing the result through an activation function,
        and passing the output to subsequent neurons.
        Each connection has a weight, signifying its importance, and biases to adjust the input. These parameters are fine-tuned during training to optimize the network's performance.
        The primary components include:
      p.mb-3.
        Here’s a breakdown of their structure and function:
      dl
        dt Input Layer
        dd
          p.
            This is the first layer of the network where raw data is input.
          p.
            Each neuron in the input layer corresponds to a single feature of the input data.
            For example, in an image recognition task, each pixel value of the image might be an input neuron.
          p.
            The input layer does not perform any computations; it simply passes the data to the next layer.

        dt Hidden Layers
        dd
          p.
            Hidden layers are where the magic happens. These layers process
            and transform data by identifying patterns and relationships.
            They consist of multiple neurons connected to adjacent layers,
            enabling the network to learn complex, non-linear representations.
          p.
            These layers are called "hidden" because their computations are not directly visible
            but are crucial for learning.

        dt Output Layer
        dd
          p.
            The output layer produces the final result of the neural network.
            This could be a classification, numerical prediction, or another output type, depending on the task.
          p.
            The number of neurons in this layer depends on the task
            (e.g., one neuron for binary classification, multiple neurons with softmax activation for multi-class tasks).

        dt Connections Between Neurons
        dd
          p.
            Neurons in a network are connected by edges,
            each assigned a weight to determine the influence of one neuron on another.
            Connections also include biases, which shift activation thresholds for greater flexibility.
          p.
            Adjusting weights and biases during training allows the network to learn and improve performance.

      p.mt-3.
        Neural networks learn through a process called training,
        involving forward propagation to generate outputs,
        loss calculation to measure errors, and backpropagation to adjust weights and biases.
        This iterative process transforms raw data into valuable predictions, making neural networks indispensable in AI.
      p.
        Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain.
        They form the foundation of many artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
        capable of solving a wide range of problems by learning from data.
        This article explores the core concepts behind neural networks
        and their role in transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and technology.
      dl
        dt What is a Neural Network?
        dd
          p.
            At its core, a neural network is a system of interconnected nodes, or "neurons,"
            that process data to recognize patterns and make decisions.
            These nodes are organized into three main types of layers:
          dl
            dt Input Layer:
            dd Takes raw data as input.
            dt Hidden Layers:

          h5.mb-0 Neural Networks Example
        .card-body
          p Practical Example: Identifying handwritten digits
          p.
            Humans effortlessly identify handwritten digits on checks, forms, or photographs,
            but this task is challenging for computers due to variations in handwriting, lighting,
            and noise in images. For example, the digit "7" may be slanted or written
            with a crossbar, while "1" may resemble a lowercase "L."
          p.
            To process a digit, an image (e.g., 28x28 pixels) is flattened into a vector of 784 numerical values,
            where each value represents the intensity of a pixel.
            This vector becomes the input layer of the neural network.
          p.
            Hidden layers transform the input data by learning hierarchical features,
            such as edges, shapes, and patterns.
            These layers apply mathematical functions to combine pixel values into increasingly
            abstract representations, making the network capable of distinguishing between digits.

          dl
            dt Input Layer
            dd
              p.
                Each pixel of a 28x28 image is an input, totaling 784 inputs.
            dt Hidden Layers
            dd
              p.
                These layers perform mathematical operations to process pixel data.
            dt Output Layer
            dd
              p.
                The output layer consists of 10 neurons, each corresponding to a possible digit (0–9).
                The network assigns a probability to each neuron. The digit with the highest probability becomes the prediction.
              p.
                The network produces 10 outputs, one for each digit.
                It selects the highest score as its prediction.
            dt Learning Process
            dd
              p.
                During training, the network compares its predictions to the correct labels.
                For instance, if it predicts "5" for an image of "7," it calculates the error
                and adjusts the network's weights using a process called backpropagation
                and an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.
                Over many iterations, this feedback loop minimizes errors.
              p.
                If the prediction is incorrect, such as predicting "5" instead of "7,"
                the network adjusts its connections to improve accuracy.
              p.
                Once trained, the network generalizes its learning to new, unseen images.
                This ability to recognize patterns it hasn’t explicitly encountered demonstrates
                the strength of neural networks in solving complex recognition tasks.

      p.mt-4.
        As neural networks continue to evolve, they remain central to advancements in artificial intelligence. By understanding their structure and applications, anyone can appreciate their transformative potential and begin exploring their use in solving real-world challenges.
