                    At its core, a neural network is a system of interconnected nodes, or "neurons,"
                    that process data to recognize patterns and make decisions.
                    These nodes are organized into three main types of layers:

                        Forward propagation in a neural network is the process where input data moves forward through
                        the layers of the network to compute a prediction.
                        It's called "forward" because the computations proceed from the input layer to the output layer sequentially,
                        one layer at a time.

                        In neural networks, loss calculation is the process of quantifying the difference between
                        the model's predictions and the actual target values.
                        This is a critical step because the loss provides feedback to the network during training,
                        guiding how its parameters (weights and biases) should be adjusted to improve performance.
                      p.
                        Loss represents the error of the model's predictions.
                        It is a single scalar value calculated for each training example or batch of examples.
                        The goal during training is to minimize the loss, making predictions closer to the true values.
                      p.
                        The loss calculation is the backbone of the learning process in neural networks.
                        It provides the feedback that drives parameter updates, ensuring the network improves over time.
                        Understanding different loss functions and their applications is crucial for designing effective neural networks.

                        Backpropagation is a cornerstone of neural network training.
                        It's the process used to optimize a network by adjusting its weights and biases based
                        on how well (or poorly) the network is performing.
                        Backpropagation works by computing gradients (a measure of change) of the loss function
                        with respect to each parameter in the network and then updating the parameters to minimize the loss.
                      ul
                        li Backpropagation happens repeatedly for many data points (epochs) until the network performs well.
                        li Chain Rule is central to computing gradients; it's like "peeling layers of an onion."
                        li Modern neural networks use optimized libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which automate backpropagation.

                .card-body
                  p.
                    Humans effortlessly identify handwritten digits on checks, forms, or photographs,
                    but this task is challenging for computers due to variations in handwriting, lighting,
                    and noise in images. For example, the digit "7" may be slanted or written
                    with a crossbar, while "1" may resemble a lowercase "L."

                  p.
                    To process a digit, an image (e.g., 28x28 pixels) is flattened into a vector of 784 numerical values,
                    where each value represents the intensity of a pixel.
                    This vector becomes the input layer of the neural network.

                  p.
                    Hidden layers transform the input data by learning hierarchical features,
                    such as edges, shapes, and patterns.
                    These layers apply mathematical functions to combine pixel values into increasingly
                    abstract representations, making the network capable of distinguishing between digits.

                      During training, the network compares its predictions to the correct labels.
                      For instance, if it predicts "5" for an image of "7," it calculates the error
                      and adjusts the network's weights using a process called backpropagation
                      and an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.
                      Over many iterations, this feedback loop minimizes errors.

                      Once trained, the network generalizes its learning to new, unseen images.
                      This ability to recognize patterns it hasn't explicitly encountered demonstrates
                      the strength of neural networks in solving complex recognition tasks.

                | Components of a Neural Network

              p.mb-4.
                Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes, often referred to as neurons or units,
                arranged in layers. Each neuron mimics the behavior of a biological neuron by taking inputs,
                applying weights and biases, processing the result through an activation function,
                and passing the output to subsequent neurons.

                      p.card-text.
                        This is the first layer of the network where raw data is input.
                        Each neuron in the input layer corresponds to a single feature of the input data.
                        For example, in an image recognition task, each pixel value of the image might be an input neuron.
                      p.card-text.mb-0.
                        The input layer does not perform any computations; it simply passes the data to the next layer.

                      p.card-text.
                        Hidden layers are where the magic happens. These layers process
                        and transform data by identifying patterns and relationships.
                        They consist of multiple neurons connected to adjacent layers,
                        enabling the network to learn complex, non-linear representations.
                      p.card-text.mb-0.
                        These layers are called "hidden" because their computations are not directly visible
                        but are crucial for learning.

                      p.card-text.
                        The output layer produces the final result of the neural network.
                        This could be a classification, numerical prediction, or another output type, depending on the task.
                      p.card-text.mb-0.
                        The number of neurons in this layer depends on the task
                        (e.g., one neuron for binary classification, multiple neurons with softmax activation for multi-class tasks).

                        each assigned a weight to determine the influence of one neuron on another.
                        Connections also include biases, which shift activation thresholds for greater flexibility.
