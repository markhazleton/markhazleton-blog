      h2#how-neural-networks-learn How Neural Networks Learn
      dd
        p.
          Neural networks learn through a process called training, which involves:
        dl
          dt Forward Propagation
          dd
            p.
              Forward propagation in a neural network is the process where input data moves forward through
              the layers of the network to compute a prediction.
              It's called "forward" because the computations proceed from the input layer to the output layer sequentially,
              one layer at a time.
            p.
              Understanding forward propagation is fundamental,
              as it builds the foundation for the training and inference processes in neural networks.
              By grasping these calculations, you can better appreciate how networks learn and make predictions.
          dt Loss Calculation
          dd
            p.
              In neural networks, loss calculation is the process of quantifying the difference between
              the model's predictions and the actual target values.
              This is a critical step because the loss provides feedback to the network during training,
              guiding how its parameters (weights and biases) should be adjusted to improve performance.
            p.
              Loss represents the error of the model’s predictions.
              It is a single scalar value calculated for each training example or batch of examples.
              The goal during training is to minimize the loss, making predictions closer to the true values.
            p.
              The loss calculation is the backbone of the learning process in neural networks.
              It provides the feedback that drives parameter updates, ensuring the network improves over time.
              Understanding different loss functions and their applications is crucial for designing effective neural networks.

          dt Backpropagation
          dd
            p.
              Backpropagation is a cornerstone of neural network training.
              It's the process used to optimize a network by adjusting its weights and biases based
              on how well (or poorly) the network is performing.
              Backpropagation works by computing gradients (a measure of change) of the loss function
              with respect to each parameter in the network and then updating the parameters to minimize the loss.
            ul
              li Backpropagation happens repeatedly for many data points (epochs) until the network performs well.
              li Chain Rule is central to computing gradients; it's like "peeling layers of an onion."
              li Modern neural networks use optimized libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which automate backpropagation.

          dt Optimization: Minimizing loss.
          dd
            p.
              In machine learning and neural networks, optimization refers to the process of finding the best set of parameters (weights and biases)
              that minimize the loss function.
              The loss function measures how far the model's predictions are from the actual values.
              The goal is to tweak the model's parameters so that the predictions get closer and closer to the actual values.
        p.
          This iterative process refines the network's connections to improve accuracy.

        h4 Key Insights About Learning
        dl
          dt Iteration is Key
          dd Neural networks don’t learn all at once. They improve step by step through feedback and gradual adjustments.
          dt Optimization is the Engine
          dd Algorithms like gradient descent drive learning, ensuring the network gets better at every step.
          dt The Role of Data
          dd High-quality, well-labeled data is essential for effective learning. The network's performance depends heavily on the examples it learns from.

        p.
          Neural networks are powerful because they can learn complex patterns in data by adjusting simple parameters repeatedly.
          At their core, they operate on basic principles: breaking problems into small steps, learning from mistakes, and improving iteratively.
          As you continue your journey in data science, understanding these foundations will help you tackle
          more complex models and applications.

          p Practical Example: Identifying handwritten digits
          p.
            Humans effortlessly identify handwritten digits on checks, forms, or photographs,
            but this task is challenging for computers due to variations in handwriting, lighting,
            and noise in images. For example, the digit "7" may be slanted or written
            with a crossbar, while "1" may resemble a lowercase "L."
          p.
            To process a digit, an image (e.g., 28x28 pixels) is flattened into a vector of 784 numerical values,
            where each value represents the intensity of a pixel.
            This vector becomes the input layer of the neural network.
          p.
            Hidden layers transform the input data by learning hierarchical features,
            such as edges, shapes, and patterns.
            These layers apply mathematical functions to combine pixel values into increasingly
            abstract representations, making the network capable of distinguishing between digits.

          dl
            dt Input Layer
            dd
              p.
                Each pixel of a 28x28 image is an input, totaling 784 inputs.
            dt Hidden Layers
            dd
              p.
                These layers perform mathematical operations to process pixel data.
            dt Output Layer
            dd
              p.
                The output layer consists of 10 neurons, each corresponding to a possible digit (0–9).
                The network assigns a probability to each neuron. The digit with the highest probability becomes the prediction.
              p.
                The network produces 10 outputs, one for each digit.
                It selects the highest score as its prediction.
            dt Learning Process
            dd
              p.
                During training, the network compares its predictions to the correct labels.
                For instance, if it predicts "5" for an image of "7," it calculates the error
                and adjusts the network's weights using a process called backpropagation
                and an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.
                Over many iterations, this feedback loop minimizes errors.
              p.
                If the prediction is incorrect, such as predicting "5" instead of "7,"
                the network adjusts its connections to improve accuracy.
              p.
                Once trained, the network generalizes its learning to new, unseen images.
                This ability to recognize patterns it hasn’t explicitly encountered demonstrates
                the strength of neural networks in solving complex recognition tasks.

      h2#components Components of a Neural Network
      p.mb-3.
        Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes, often referred to as neurons or units,
        arranged in layers. Each neuron mimics the behavior of a biological neuron by taking inputs,
        applying weights and biases, processing the result through an activation function,
        and passing the output to subsequent neurons.
        Each connection has a weight, signifying its importance, and biases to adjust the input. These parameters are fine-tuned during training to optimize the network's performance.
        The primary components include:
      p.mb-3.
        Here’s a breakdown of their structure and function:
      dl
        dt Input Layer
        dd
          p.
            This is the first layer of the network where raw data is input.
          p.
            Each neuron in the input layer corresponds to a single feature of the input data.
            For example, in an image recognition task, each pixel value of the image might be an input neuron.
          p.
            The input layer does not perform any computations; it simply passes the data to the next layer.

        dt Hidden Layers
        dd
          p.
            Hidden layers are where the magic happens. These layers process
            and transform data by identifying patterns and relationships.
            They consist of multiple neurons connected to adjacent layers,
            enabling the network to learn complex, non-linear representations.
          p.
            These layers are called "hidden" because their computations are not directly visible
            but are crucial for learning.

        dt Output Layer
        dd
          p.
            The output layer produces the final result of the neural network.
            This could be a classification, numerical prediction, or another output type, depending on the task.
          p.
            The number of neurons in this layer depends on the task
            (e.g., one neuron for binary classification, multiple neurons with softmax activation for multi-class tasks).

        dt Connections Between Neurons
        dd
          p.
            Neurons in a network are connected by edges,
            each assigned a weight to determine the influence of one neuron on another.
            Connections also include biases, which shift activation thresholds for greater flexibility.
          p.
            Adjusting weights and biases during training allows the network to learn and improve performance.
