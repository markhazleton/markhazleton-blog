        Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain.
        They form the foundation of many artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
        capable of solving a wide range of problems by learning from data.
        This article explores the core concepts behind neural networks
        and their role in transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and technology.
      dl
        dt What is a Neural Network?
        dd
          p.
            At its core, a neural network is a system of interconnected nodes, or "neurons,"
            that process data to recognize patterns and make decisions.
            These nodes are organized into three main types of layers:
          dl
            dt Input Layer:
            dd Takes raw data as input.
            dt Hidden Layers:
            dd Processes data to find patterns.
            dt Output Layer:
            dd Produces predictions or classifications.
          p.

        dt How Do Neural Networks Learn?
        dd
          p.
            Neural networks learn through a process called training, which involves:
          dl
            dt Forward Propagation
            dd
              p.
                Forward propagation in a neural network is the process where input data moves forward through
                the layers of the network to compute a prediction.
                It's called "forward" because the computations proceed from the input layer to the output layer sequentially,
                one layer at a time.
              p.
                Understanding forward propagation is fundamental,
                as it builds the foundation for the training and inference processes in neural networks.
                By grasping these calculations, you can better appreciate how networks learn and make predictions.
            dt Loss Calculation
            dd
              p.
                In neural networks, loss calculation is the process of quantifying the difference between
                the model's predictions and the actual target values.
                This is a critical step because the loss provides feedback to the network during training,
                guiding how its parameters (weights and biases) should be adjusted to improve performance.
              p.
                Loss represents the error of the model’s predictions.
                It is a single scalar value calculated for each training example or batch of examples.
                The goal during training is to minimize the loss, making predictions closer to the true values.
              p.
                The loss calculation is the backbone of the learning process in neural networks.
                It provides the feedback that drives parameter updates, ensuring the network improves over time.
                Understanding different loss functions and their applications is crucial for designing effective neural networks.

            dt Backpropagation
            dd
              p.
                Backpropagation is a cornerstone of neural network training.
                It's the process used to optimize a network by adjusting its weights and biases based
                on how well (or poorly) the network is performing.
                Backpropagation works by computing gradients (a measure of change) of the loss function
                with respect to each parameter in the network and then updating the parameters to minimize the loss.
              ul
                li Backpropagation happens repeatedly for many data points (epochs) until the network performs well.
                li Chain Rule is central to computing gradients; it's like "peeling layers of an onion."
                li Modern neural networks use optimized libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which automate backpropagation.

            dt Optimization: Minimizing loss.
            dd
              p.
                In machine learning and neural networks, optimization refers to the process of finding the best set of parameters (weights and biases)
                that minimize the loss function.
                The loss function measures how far the model's predictions are from the actual values.
                The goal is to tweak the model's parameters so that the predictions get closer and closer to the actual values.
          p.
            This iterative process refines the network's connections to improve accuracy.

          h4 Key Insights About Learning
          dl
            dt Iteration is Key
            dd Neural networks don’t learn all at once. They improve step by step through feedback and gradual adjustments.
            dt Optimization is the Engine
            dd Algorithms like gradient descent drive learning, ensuring the network gets better at every step.
            dt The Role of Data
            dd High-quality, well-labeled data is essential for effective learning. The network's performance depends heavily on the examples it learns from.

          p.
            Neural networks are powerful because they can learn complex patterns in data by adjusting simple parameters repeatedly.
            At their core, they operate on basic principles: breaking problems into small steps, learning from mistakes, and improving iteratively.
            As you continue your journey in data science, understanding these foundations will help you tackle
            more complex models and applications.

          h5.mb-0 Neural Networks Example
        .card-body
          p Practical Example: Identifying handwritten digits
          p.
            Humans effortlessly identify handwritten digits on checks, forms, or photographs,
            but this task is challenging for computers due to variations in handwriting, lighting,
            and noise in images. For example, the digit "7" may be slanted or written
            with a crossbar, while "1" may resemble a lowercase "L."
          p.
            To process a digit, an image (e.g., 28x28 pixels) is flattened into a vector of 784 numerical values,
            where each value represents the intensity of a pixel.
            This vector becomes the input layer of the neural network.
          p.
            Hidden layers transform the input data by learning hierarchical features,
            such as edges, shapes, and patterns.
            These layers apply mathematical functions to combine pixel values into increasingly
            abstract representations, making the network capable of distinguishing between digits.

          dl
            dt Input Layer
            dd
              p.
                Each pixel of a 28x28 image is an input, totaling 784 inputs.
            dt Hidden Layers
            dd
              p.
                These layers perform mathematical operations to process pixel data.
            dt Output Layer
            dd
              p.
                The output layer consists of 10 neurons, each corresponding to a possible digit (0–9).
                The network assigns a probability to each neuron. The digit with the highest probability becomes the prediction.
              p.
                The network produces 10 outputs, one for each digit.
                It selects the highest score as its prediction.
            dt Learning Process
            dd
              p.
                During training, the network compares its predictions to the correct labels.
                For instance, if it predicts "5" for an image of "7," it calculates the error
                and adjusts the network's weights using a process called backpropagation
                and an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.
                Over many iterations, this feedback loop minimizes errors.
              p.
                If the prediction is incorrect, such as predicting "5" instead of "7,"
                the network adjusts its connections to improve accuracy.
              p.
                Once trained, the network generalizes its learning to new, unseen images.
                This ability to recognize patterns it hasn’t explicitly encountered demonstrates
                the strength of neural networks in solving complex recognition tasks.

      h4 Components of a Neural Network:
      p.mb-3.
        Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes, often referred to as neurons or units,
        arranged in layers. Each neuron mimics the behavior of a biological neuron by taking inputs,
        applying weights and biases, processing the result through an activation function,
        and passing the output to subsequent neurons.
        Each connection has a weight, signifying its importance, and biases to adjust the input. These parameters are fine-tuned during training to optimize the network's performance.
        The primary components include:
      p.mb-3.
        Here’s a breakdown of their structure and function:
      dl
        dt Input Layer
        dd
          p.
            This is the first layer of the network where raw data is input.
          p.
            Each neuron in the input layer corresponds to a single feature of the input data.
            For example, in an image recognition task, each pixel value of the image might be an input neuron.
          p.
            The input layer does not perform any computations; it simply passes the data to the next layer.

        dt Hidden Layers
        dd
          p.
            Hidden layers are where the magic happens. These layers process
            and transform data by identifying patterns and relationships.
            They consist of multiple neurons connected to adjacent layers,
            enabling the network to learn complex, non-linear representations.
          p.
            These layers are called "hidden" because their computations are not directly visible
            but are crucial for learning.

        dt Output Layer
        dd
          p.
            The output layer produces the final result of the neural network.
            This could be a classification, numerical prediction, or another output type, depending on the task.
          p.
            The number of neurons in this layer depends on the task
            (e.g., one neuron for binary classification, multiple neurons with softmax activation for multi-class tasks).

        dt Connections Between Neurons
        dd
          p.
            Neurons in a network are connected by edges,
            each assigned a weight to determine the influence of one neuron on another.
            Connections also include biases, which shift activation thresholds for greater flexibility.
          p.
            Adjusting weights and biases during training allows the network to learn and improve performance.


      p.mt-4.
        As neural networks continue to evolve, they remain central to advancements in artificial intelligence.
        By understanding their structure and applications, anyone can appreciate their transformative potential
        and begin exploring their use in solving real-world challenges.

      h2.subheading.mb-3 A timeline of key milestones in neural network development.
      p.
        Neural networks have a storied history, beginning with their theoretical foundation in the 1940s and evolving into the backbone of modern artificial intelligence. This timeline highlights pivotal moments that have shaped the field.

              p.
                In 1943, the field of artificial intelligence and neural networks took its first major step
                with the groundbreaking work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.
                Their seminal paper, "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity,"
                introduced the first mathematical model of a neural network.
                This model was inspired by the way biological neurons process information in the brain.
                McCulloch and Pitts proposed that neurons could be represented as simple binary on/off units,
                which could perform logical operations. By connecting these units,
                they demonstrated how complex computations could be achieved,
                laying the foundation for what we now recognize as artificial neural networks.
              p.
                This theoretical framework was revolutionary at the time,
                offering a new lens through which to view both human cognition and machine intelligence.
                The McCulloch-Pitts model proved that any logical function could be computed using networks
                of artificial neurons, given the right configuration. While their work was limited
                to conceptual ideas and simple implementations due to the technological constraints of their era,
                it provided an essential intellectual bridge between neuroscience and computer science,
                igniting decades of research that would eventually culminate in the development of modern AI systems.

            div.accordion-body
              p.
                In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt introduced the Perceptron,
                marking a significant milestone in the evolution of neural networks.
                The Perceptron was the first practical model of an artificial neural network capable of learning from data.
                It was inspired by biological neurons and designed to classify inputs into two categories
                by adjusting weights based on errors, a process known as supervised learning.
                Demonstrated on the IBM 704 computer, Rosenblatt’s Perceptron successfully performed basic
                pattern recognition tasks, showcasing the potential of machines to learn and adapt.
                This was a pivotal achievement, as it offered a tangible implementation of concepts previously limited to theory.
              p.
                The Perceptron’s simplicity and effectiveness captured widespread attention,
                with some proclaiming it as a harbinger of machine intelligence.
                However, its limitations soon became apparent. The model struggled with problems that were not linearly separable,
                such as the XOR problem, which Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert later highlighted in their book "Perceptrons".
                Despite these shortcomings, the Perceptron played a crucial role in advancing the field
                by sparking interest in neural networks and their potential applications.
                It laid the groundwork for more complex models, setting the stage for the development
                of multi-layer networks and sophisticated learning algorithms in subsequent decades.

              p.
                During the 1960s and 1970s, the field of neural networks saw important developments as well as
                significant challenges that shaped its trajectory. Bernard Widrow and Ted Hoff introduced the
                Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron) and Madaline (Multiple Adaline) networks, which expanded on the ideas
                introduced by the Perceptron. These networks utilized weighted connections and adaptive
                learning algorithms to solve practical problems such as noise cancellation and signal processing.
                Adaline, in particular, used the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, which adjusted weights based
                on continuous error values rather than binary feedback,
                making it more robust and versatile. These innovations demonstrated the practical utility
                of neural networks in engineering and industrial applications.
              p.
                However, this period also highlighted the limitations of early neural network models.
                In 1969, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published their influential book, "Perceptrons,"
                which rigorously analyzed the capabilities and constraints of single-layer neural networks.
                They demonstrated that simple models like the Perceptron could not solve non-linearly separable problems,
                such as the XOR problem. This revelation led to a decline in interest and funding for
                neural network research, often referred to as the "AI winter." While their critique was accurate
                for single-layer networks, it overlooked the potential of multi-layer architectures,
                which would later become the foundation for modern deep learning.
                Despite the slowdown, the foundational work during this era laid the intellectual groundwork
                for future breakthroughs in neural networks and machine learning.

                The 1980s marked a turning point in neural network research with the resurgence of interest
                fueled by the introduction and popularization of backpropagation.
                David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams, in their influential 1986 paper,
                demonstrated how backpropagation could effectively train multilayer neural networks.
                Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors," is an algorithm that calculates gradients
                of a loss function with respect to network weights, enabling adjustments to minimize error.
                This innovation solved a critical challenge in neural networks: efficiently training deep,
                multilayered architectures that had previously been impractical to optimize.
              p.
                Backpropagation’s impact was transformative, reigniting enthusiasm in the field and inspiring
                a wave of research into artificial intelligence and machine learning.
                Researchers now had a robust tool to tackle complex problems that simple models like
                the Perceptron could not handle, including non-linear decision boundaries and multi-class classification.

                In 2014, Ian Goodfellow introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a revolutionary framework
                in machine learning that enabled neural networks to generate highly realistic images and data.
                GANs consist of two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—trained simultaneously
                in a game-like setting. The generator creates synthetic data, such as images,
                while the discriminator evaluates whether the data is real or generated.
                Through this adversarial process, both networks improve iteratively: the generator learns
                to create more convincing data, and the discriminator becomes better at identifying fakes.
                This dynamic interplay allows GANs to produce outputs that are remarkably indistinguishable
                from real data.
              p.
                The introduction of GANs opened new frontiers in AI, especially in creative and generative tasks.

                and creating deepfake videos to more advanced uses like drug discovery and creating synthetic
                datasets for training AI models. GANs also sparked interest in adversarial learning,
                paving the way for advancements in generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
                and diffusion models. Ian Goodfellow's breakthrough fundamentally changed the landscape
                of AI research and demonstrated how neural networks could be leveraged not only for classification
                and prediction but also for creative and innovative problem-solving.
