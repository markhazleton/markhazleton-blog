      h1 Python: The Language of Data Science
      h2.subheading.mb-3 How Python Evolved to Dominate Data Science
      p.
        Python, created by Guido van Rossum in 1989, began as a hobby project aimed at improving on the
        limitations of the ABC programming language.
        Van Rossum wanted to create a language that was both simple to read and powerful enough
        to handle complex projects.
      p.
        Today, Python has become one of the most popular languages in the world, particularly in the
        fields of data science and machine learning.
        I want to take you through Python’s history, its evolution, and why it is the go-to language
        for data scientists today.

      h2 The Origins of Python and the Problems It Solved
      p.
        In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum started working on Python with the goal of creating a versatile,
        high-level programming language that focused on readability and ease of use.
        Inspired by the simplicity of ABC but frustrated by its limitations, Van Rossum designed
        Python to be easy enough for beginners while still offering advanced features for experienced developers.
      p.
        One of the major problems Python solved was making programming more accessible without sacrificing power.
        Its clear syntax reduced the complexity of writing code, allowing for rapid prototyping,
        especially in research and scientific environments.
      p.
        Python was also intended to support multiple programming paradigms.
        This flexibility allowed developers to write code in a variety of styles,
        from object-oriented to functional programming.
        By combining simplicity with power, Python became an excellent tool for both
        teaching programming and developing complex systems.

      h2 Python’s Name and Lore
      p.
        The name "Python" is a tribute to Van Rossum's love for the British comedy group Monty Python,
        reflecting his vision of the language as fun and approachable.
        Over the years, the Python community has embraced this playful spirit,
        resulting in a culture that celebrates humor, exemplified by Easter eggs
        like "The Zen of Python" which outlines the language’s philosophy in a witty manner.

          h3 Zen of Python
        .card-body
          p.
            In order to see the Zen of Python, open a Python shell and type `import this`.
            You will be greeted with a set of guiding principles that capture the essence of Python’s design philosophy.
            The Zen of Python consists of 19 aphorisms, each representing a fundamental guideline for writing Pythonic code. Let's explore these principles in detail.

          .accordion(id="zen-python-accordion")

            // Accordion Item 1
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseOne")
                  | Beautiful is better than ugly
              .accordion-collapse.collapse.show#collapseOne
                .accordion-body
                  p Python emphasizes clean, readable code. This principle is a call to write code that is aesthetically pleasing, easy to read, and not overly complex.

            // Accordion Item 2
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseTwo")
                  | Explicit is better than implicit
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseTwo
                .accordion-body
                  p Code should be straightforward and avoid hidden behaviors. Making the flow and logic of the code clear makes it easier for others to maintain and extend it.

            // Accordion Item 3
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseThree")
                  | Simple is better than complex
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseThree
                .accordion-body
                  p Simplicity is a core Python value. When faced with a problem, choose the simplest solution that works, as complexity can lead to errors and confusion.

            // Accordion Item 4
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseFour")
                  | Complex is better than complicated
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseFour
                .accordion-body
                  p While complexity is sometimes necessary, it should not be confused with over-complication. The Zen advises to keep complexity manageable and avoid convoluted solutions.

            // Accordion Item 5
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseFive")
                  | Flat is better than nested
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseFive
                .accordion-body
                  p Deeply nested structures are harder to understand and maintain. The principle advises against excessive use of hierarchies in code, favoring a flatter structure.

            // Accordion Item 6
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseSix")
                  | Sparse is better than dense
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseSix
                .accordion-body
                  p Code should not try to do too much in a single line. Dense, one-liner code may be impressive, but it is often hard to read and maintain.

            // Accordion Item 7
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseSeven")
                  | Readability counts
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseSeven
                .accordion-body
                  p Readable code is critical for collaboration. Python encourages well-documented, easy-to-read code over terse or cryptic implementations.

            // Accordion Item 8
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseEight")
                  | Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseEight
                .accordion-body
                  p While some scenarios may tempt developers to break conventions, Pythonic code adheres to general best practices even in exceptional cases.

            // Accordion Item 9
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseNine")
                  | Although practicality beats purity
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseNine
                .accordion-body
                  p This principle tempers the previous one, acknowledging that there are cases where pragmatic solutions may override rigid adherence to rules.

            // Accordion Item 10
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseTen")
                  | Errors should never pass silently
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseTen
                .accordion-body
                  p Python favors raising exceptions rather than silently failing, making debugging easier and code behavior clearer.

            // Accordion Item 11
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseEleven")
                  | Unless explicitly silenced
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseEleven
                .accordion-body
                  p There are rare cases where it's acceptable to silence errors deliberately, as long as this choice is clearly documented.

            // Accordion Item 12
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseTwelve")
                  | In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseTwelve
                .accordion-body
                  p When code is ambiguous, it’s best to clarify rather than make assumptions. Guessing leads to fragile code that may break unexpectedly.

            // Accordion Item 13
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header

                  | There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseThirteen
                .accordion-body
                  p Python emphasizes having a clear and well-defined solution for most problems, minimizing ambiguity for developers.

                  | Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseFourteen
                .accordion-body
                  p A humorous reference to Python's Dutch creator, Guido van Rossum, indicating that not all solutions are immediately clear but become so over time.

            // Accordion Item 15
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
                button.accordion-button.collapsed(type="button", data-bs-toggle="collapse", data-bs-target="#collapseFifteen")
                  | Now is better than never
              .accordion-collapse.collapse#collapseFifteen
                .accordion-body
                  p This encourages timely execution in coding, avoiding procrastination.

            // Accordion Item 16
            .accordion-item
              h2.accordion-header
