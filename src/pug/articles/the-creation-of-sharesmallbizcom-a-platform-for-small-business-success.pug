      h1 The Creation of ShareSmallBiz.com
      h2.subheading.mb-3 A Platform for Small Business Success

      p.
        The idea for ShareSmallBiz.com was born from the successful partnership between Jonathan Roper and Mark Hazleton in building WichitaSewer.com,
        a digital presence for Jonathan’s sewer and drain service company. This experience highlighted the power of collaboration, strategic digital marketing,
        and the importance of small businesses supporting each other to thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace.

      h2 Recognizing the Need for a Shared Platform

        | After launching WichitaSewer.com, Jonathan and Mark saw firsthand how a well-executed online strategy could transform a business. However, they also
        | recognized a gap: many small businesses struggle to gain visibility, attract customers, and compete against larger corporations.

      p.
        They asked themselves:

      ul
        li What if small business owners worked together to amplify their marketing efforts?
        li What if they shared knowledge, cross-promoted each other, and pooled resources to reach a larger audience?
        li Could a dedicated platform be the solution to breaking through the barriers that small businesses face?

      p.
        From these questions, ShareSmallBiz.com was born—a community-driven social media platform designed to connect, empower, and grow small businesses
        through collaboration and shared marketing.
