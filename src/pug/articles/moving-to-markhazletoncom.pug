      p.
        Learn why transitioning to MarkHazleton.com was crucial for consolidating SEO efforts and improving brand authority.
        Discover the benefits of moving from a sub-domain to a top-level domain.
      p.
        For a while, my website was nestled comfortably under a sub-domain, doing its job without much fuss.
        However, I started to notice that having a sub-domain was limiting the potential of my brand in several ways.
        Search engines often treat sub-domains as separate entities, which can dilute SEO efforts and make it harder to rank consistently.
        Additionally, having a memorable, authoritative top-level domain carries a certain professional polish that a sub-domain just can't match.
      p
        | I discovered that the perfect domain,
        strong MarkHazleton.com
        |, was available. It was an opportunity too good to pass up!
        | Owning a top-level domain that directly matches my name not only strengthens my personal brand but also consolidates all my SEO efforts under one roof.
        | I knew it was time to pull the trigger and make the move.
      p.
        Transitioning to MarkHazleton.com felt like a natural evolution, aligning my online presence with the professionalism and clarity I aim to project.
        It was more than just a domain name change; it was a strategic step forward for my brand.

                  Duplicate content refers to identical or significantly similar content that appears on multiple URLs,
                  either within the same domain or across different domains.
                  This can confuse search engines and dilute your SEO efforts, as they may struggle to determine which version to rank.
                  During a domain migration, it's essential to avoid serving the same content on both the old and new domains simultaneously.

                  Once the 301 redirects are set up and functioning correctly from your old domain to your new domain,
                  you should no longer need to update the old site.
                  Instead, focus on ensuring the new domain is indexed properly.
                  Use Google Search Console to monitor for any issues with pages not being indexed or duplicate content alerts.

                  Backlinks, also known as inbound links, are links from other websites pointing to your domain. They are crucial for SEO as they indicate your content's authority and relevance.

        h2.subheading.mb-3 Migrating to markhazleton.com: A Step-by-Step Guide
        p.
          Moving my blog from markhazleton.controlorigins.com to markhazleton.com involved several technical steps, especially since my site is hosted on Azure Static Web Apps with Cloudflare managing DNS. Here’s how I navigated the process, including setting up DNS rules and routing with Cloudflare.
        dl
          dt Step 1: Planning the Site Move
          dd
            p.
              I began by thoroughly planning the move, auditing my current site using Screaming Frog to create a complete inventory of URLs.
              I set up markhazleton.com on Azure Static Web Apps, ensuring it was fully functional with the same content as the old domain.
              Verification of both domains in Google Search Console was crucial for using the Change of Address feature.

          dt Step 2: Setting Up Cloudflare DNS
          dd
            p  I configured Cloudflare to handle the DNS for markhazleton.com. Here's what I did:
            ul
              li Added markhazleton.com to Cloudflare and changed the domain's nameservers to point to Cloudflare.
              li Configured DNS records to direct traffic to the Azure Static Web Apps endpoint.
              li Ensured that both A and CNAME records were correctly pointing to Azure's IP addresses or endpoints.



          dt Step 3: Configuring Cloudflare Page Rules for Routing
          dd
            p  To manage routing, I used Cloudflare's Page Rules:
            ul
              li.
                Set up a page rule to forward all traffic from markhazleton.controlorigins.com to markhazleton.com using a 301 redirect.
                This rule was crucial to inform search engines that the move was permanent.
                You must keep your DNS settings for CNAMES and A records on the old domain so the page rules work correctly.
              li Configured additional rules to cache static content and optimize loading times, which was beneficial given the static nature of Azure Static Web Apps.

          dt Step 4: Updating Google Search Console with Change of Address
          dd
            |  I submitted the Change of Address request in Google Search Console to notify Google about the domain change. It was important to confirm that the 301 redirects were fully operational before this step.

          dt Step 5: Updating Internal Links and Sitemaps
          dd
            |  After migrating, I updated all internal links to point to the new domain. This included links within content, navigation, and footers. I also generated a new sitemap for markhazleton.com and submitted it to Google Search Console, ensuring the old domain’s sitemap included 301 redirects.

          dt Step 6: Monitoring the Migration Process
          dd
            |  Post-migration monitoring was essential. I regularly checked Google Search Console for crawl errors and indexing issues, and I monitored site traffic on both domains using Google Analytics. This helped me quickly address any issues that arose during the migration.

          dt Step 7: Updating External Links and Backlinks
          dd
            |  I contacted webmasters of high-value backlinks to update their links to the new domain. Additionally, I updated my profiles on social media, business directories, and other platforms to reflect the domain change.

          dt Step 8: Notifying My Audience and Updating Profiles
          dd
            |  I announced the domain change to my audience via a blog post, newsletters, and social media updates. This communication was important to keep my audience informed and to maintain traffic levels during the transition.

          dt Step 9: Final Checks and Ongoing Monitoring
          dd
            |  For the first few months, I continued to monitor the migration’s impact on search rankings and site performance. Google’s “Move In Process” message remained visible in Search Console for some time but eventually disappeared once the new domain was fully indexed.
