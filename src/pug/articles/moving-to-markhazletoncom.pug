            p.mb-3
              | My site was living at markhazleton.controlorigins.com, which worked fine but felt a bit clunky.
              | When I noticed that MarkHazleton.com was available, it seemed like a no-brainer to grab it.
            
            p.mb-3
              | There were a few reasons the move made sense:
            
            ul.mb-4
              li.mb-2 A cleaner, more professional URL that's easier to remember
              li.mb-2 Better for SEO since search engines treat subdomains differently
              li.mb-2 More control over my online brand
              li More straightforward to manage everything in one place
            
            p.mb-0
              | Plus, having your own name as a domain just feels right when you're building a personal brand.

            h2.h4.mb-3 SEO considerations
            
            p.mb-4
              | The biggest concern with moving domains is losing your search rankings.
              | I'd spent time building up the SEO value of my old domain, so I wanted to make sure I didn't throw that away.
              | Here's what I learned about keeping your SEO intact during a move:

            h3.h5.mb-3 The key steps
            
            p.mb-3
              strong 1. Plan carefully
            p.mb-3
              | I scheduled the move during a low-traffic time and made sure I had a complete backup of everything.
              | I also used Screaming Frog to audit all my current URLs so I knew exactly what needed to be redirected.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong 2. Set up 301 redirects
            p.mb-3
              | This is crucial - you want all your old URLs to automatically redirect to the new ones.
              | I used Cloudflare's Page Rules to set up the redirects, which made it pretty straightforward.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong 3. Update Google Search Console
            p.mb-3
              | Google has a "Change of Address" tool specifically for this situation.
              | You need to verify both domains in Search Console first, then you can tell Google about the move.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong 4. Update internal links
            p.mb-3
              | Go through your site and update any internal links to point to the new domain.
              | Don't forget navigation menus, footer links, and any hard-coded links in your content.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong 5. Update external links when possible
            p.mb-3
              | Reach out to sites that link to you and ask them to update to the new domain.
              | Focus on the high-authority sites first - those are the most valuable.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong 6. Submit new sitemap
            p.mb-4
              | Generate a new sitemap for your new domain and submit it to Google Search Console and Bing.

          section#migration-steps.mb-5
            h2.h4.mb-3 How I did the migration
            
            p.mb-3
              | Here's how I actually went about moving my site from the subdomain to the new domain.
              | My setup uses Azure Static Web Apps for hosting and Cloudflare for DNS, which made some parts easier.
            
            h3.h5.mb-3 Step 1: Planning and preparation
            p.mb-3
              | Before doing anything, I used Screaming Frog to crawl my entire site and create a complete inventory of all URLs.
              | This helped me understand exactly what needed to be redirected and identify any potential issues.
            
            p.mb-3
              | I also set up the new markhazleton.com domain on Azure Static Web Apps with identical content to make sure everything worked before switching over.
              | Both domains needed to be verified in Google Search Console to use their Change of Address tool later.
            
            h3.h5.mb-3 Step 2: Setting up DNS with Cloudflare
            p.mb-3
              | First, I added markhazleton.com to Cloudflare and changed the domain's nameservers to point to Cloudflare.
              | Then I configured the DNS records to direct traffic to my Azure Static Web Apps endpoint.
            
            p.mb-3
              | The key was making sure both A records and CNAME records were correctly pointing to Azure's IP addresses.
              | I kept the old domain's DNS settings active too, since the redirects wouldn't work without them.
            
            h3.h5.mb-3 Step 3: Configuring redirects with Page Rules
            p.mb-3
              | This was the most critical part. I used Cloudflare's Page Rules to set up 301 redirects from the old domain to the new one.
              | The rule pattern was simple: markhazleton.controlorigins.com/* redirects to markhazleton.com/$1
            
            .bg-light.p-3.rounded.mb-4
              p.mb-2
                strong About Cloudflare Page Rules:
              p.mb-2
                | Page Rules let you create redirects without touching server configuration. You just set up a pattern that matches your old URLs and redirects them to the new domain.
              p.mb-0
                | The $1 variable captures everything after the domain name and appends it to the new URL, so /articles/some-post redirects to markhazleton.com/articles/some-post.
            
            h3.h5.mb-3 Step 4: Telling Google about the move
            p.mb-3
              | Once the redirects were working properly, I used Google's Change of Address tool in Search Console.
              | This officially tells Google that the site has moved and helps transfer the SEO value from the old domain to the new one.
            
            p.mb-3
              | The process took a few weeks to complete, and Google showed a "Move In Process" message during that time.
              | It's important not to panic if you see temporary ranking fluctuations during this period.
            
            h3.h5.mb-3 Step 5: Cleanup and monitoring
            p.mb-3
              | After the technical migration, there was still plenty of work to do:
            
            ul.mb-3
              li.mb-2 Updated all internal links to use the new domain
              li.mb-2 Generated and submitted a new sitemap to search engines
              li.mb-2 Reached out to high-authority sites to update their backlinks
              li.mb-2 Updated social media profiles and business listings
              li Updated email signatures and any printed materials

            p.mb-3
              strong Cloudflare makes DNS management easy.
              | Their Page Rules feature is particularly helpful for setting up redirects without needing server-level configuration.
              | The web interface is intuitive and changes propagate quickly.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Keep both domains' DNS active.
              | This was crucial - if you disable the old domain's DNS before the redirects are working, you'll lose traffic.
              | I kept the old domain active for several months to be safe.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Test everything before going live.
              | I set up the new domain completely before switching any redirects.
              | This let me verify that all the content was working correctly on the new domain.
            
            h3.h6.mb-3 SEO and timing insights
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Patience is key.
              | It took Google about 6-8 weeks to fully process the domain change and update the old domain status to "Moved" in Search Console.
              | Rankings and traffic returned to normal well before that though.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Monitor everything closely.
              | I checked Google Search Console and Analytics daily for the first month to catch any issues early.
              | There were temporary fluctuations, but nothing that required intervention.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Timing matters.
              | I scheduled the migration during a low-traffic period to minimize disruption.
              | Having advance warning through social media and email helped maintain audience engagement.
            
            h3.h6.mb-3 Communication insights
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Tell people about the change.
              | I announced it through a blog post, newsletter, and social media.
              | Most people were understanding, and some even congratulated me on getting my name domain.
            
            p.mb-4
              strong Update external references gradually.
              | Not everyone will update their links immediately, but the 301 redirects handle that.
              | I prioritized reaching out to high-authority sites first since those links are most valuable.

            p.mb-3
              | While my migration went smoothly overall, I did encounter a few bumps along the way.
              | Here are the most common issues and how to handle them:
            
            h3.h6.mb-3 Redirect issues
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Problem: Redirects not working
              | If your redirects aren't working, first check that your old domain's DNS is still active.
              | Then verify the Page Rule pattern in Cloudflare - it's easy to make syntax errors.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Problem: Redirect loops
              | This happens when you accidentally create circular redirects.
              | Make sure your new domain isn't redirecting back to the old one anywhere.
            
            h3.h6.mb-3 Search Console issues
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Problem: "Move In Process" taking too long
              | Google's Change of Address process can take 6-8 weeks.
              | As long as your redirects are working and you're not seeing major traffic drops, be patient.
            
            p.mb-3
              strong Problem: New domain not being indexed
              | Submit your sitemap to Search Console and request indexing for your most important pages.
              | Make sure your robots.txt file isn't blocking search engines.
