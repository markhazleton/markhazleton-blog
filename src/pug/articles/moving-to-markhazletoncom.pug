      h2.subheading.mb-3 The Decision to Migrate to MarkHazleton.com
      p.
        For a while, my website was nestled comfortably under a sub-domain, doing its job without much fuss.
        However, I started to notice that having a sub-domain was limiting the potential of my brand in several ways.
        Search engines often treat sub-domains as separate entities, which can dilute SEO efforts and make it harder to rank consistently.
        Additionally, having a memorable, authoritative top-level domain carries a certain professional polish that a sub-domain just can't match.

      h2.subheading.mb-3 Migrating to markhazleton.com: A Step-by-Step Guide
      p.
        Moving my blog from markhazleton.controlorigins.com to markhazleton.com involved several technical steps, especially since my site is hosted on Azure Static Web Apps with Cloudflare managing DNS. Here’s how I navigated the process, including setting up DNS rules and routing with Cloudflare.
      dl
        dt Step 1: Planning the Site Move
        dd
          strong Time Estimate: 1-2 Days
          p.
            I began by thoroughly planning the move, auditing my current site using Screaming Frog to create a complete inventory of URLs.
            I set up markhazleton.com on Azure Static Web Apps, ensuring it was fully functional with the same content as the old domain.
            Verification of both domains in Google Search Console was crucial for using the Change of Address feature.

        dt Step 2: Setting Up Cloudflare DNS
        dd
          strong  Time Estimate: 1 Day
          p  I configured Cloudflare to handle the DNS for markhazleton.com. Here's what I did:
          ul
            li Added markhazleton.com to Cloudflare and changed the domain's nameservers to point to Cloudflare.
            li Configured DNS records to direct traffic to the Azure Static Web Apps endpoint.
            li Ensured that both A and CNAME records were correctly pointing to Azure's IP addresses or endpoints.



        dt Step 3: Configuring Cloudflare Page Rules for Routing
        dd
          strong  Time Estimate: 1 Day
          p  To manage routing, I used Cloudflare's Page Rules:
          ul
            li.
              Set up a page rule to forward all traffic from markhazleton.controlorigins.com to markhazleton.com using a 301 redirect.
              This rule was crucial to inform search engines that the move was permanent.
              You must keep your DNS settings for CNAMES and A records on the old domain so the page rules work correctly.
            li Configured additional rules to cache static content and optimize loading times, which was beneficial given the static nature of Azure Static Web Apps.

        dt Step 4: Updating Google Search Console with Change of Address
        dd
          |  Time Estimate: 1 Day
          |  I submitted the Change of Address request in Google Search Console to notify Google about the domain change. It was important to confirm that the 301 redirects were fully operational before this step.

        dt Step 5: Updating Internal Links and Sitemaps
        dd
          |  Time Estimate: 2-3 Days
          |  After migrating, I updated all internal links to point to the new domain. This included links within content, navigation, and footers. I also generated a new sitemap for markhazleton.com and submitted it to Google Search Console, ensuring the old domain’s sitemap included 301 redirects.

        dt Step 6: Monitoring the Migration Process
        dd
          |  Time Estimate: Ongoing (Initial 1-2 Weeks Intensive Monitoring)
          |  Post-migration monitoring was essential. I regularly checked Google Search Console for crawl errors and indexing issues, and I monitored site traffic on both domains using Google Analytics. This helped me quickly address any issues that arose during the migration.

        dt Step 7: Updating External Links and Backlinks
        dd
          |  Time Estimate: 1-2 Weeks (Ongoing)
          |  I contacted webmasters of high-value backlinks to update their links to the new domain. Additionally, I updated my profiles on social media, business directories, and other platforms to reflect the domain change.

        dt Step 8: Notifying My Audience and Updating Profiles
        dd
          |  Time Estimate: 1-2 Days
          |  I announced the domain change to my audience via a blog post, newsletters, and social media updates. This communication was important to keep my audience informed and to maintain traffic levels during the transition.

        dt Step 9: Final Checks and Ongoing Monitoring
        dd
          |  Time Estimate: Ongoing (First 3 Months)
          |  For the first few months, I continued to monitor the migration’s impact on search rankings and site performance. Google’s “Move In Process” message remained visible in Search Console for some time but eventually disappeared once the new domain was fully indexed.

      h2 Lessons Learned and Best Practices
      dl
        dt Using Cloudflare DNS for Seamless Domain Management
        dd
          |  Cloudflare made DNS management and routing configuration straightforward. Its Page Rules feature was particularly useful for setting up efficient and SEO-friendly redirects.

        dt Consistent Branding and Seamless User Experience
        dd
          |  Keeping branding consistent across both domains was key to ensuring a seamless transition for users. This helped maintain the trust and familiarity of my audience during the move.

        dt Proactive Monitoring and Adjustments
        dd
          |  Regular checks in Google Search Console and Google Analytics were crucial for identifying and addressing any issues promptly. Adjustments were made as needed based on real-time data.

      dl
        dt Total Time Estimate
        dd
          |  From planning to post-migration monitoring, the process took approximately 1 to 3 months. This allowed ample time for testing and adjustments to ensure a smooth transition.

        dt Managing Fluctuations in Rankings and Traffic
        dd
          |  Temporary fluctuations in search rankings and traffic were expected and occurred as Google processed the domain change. These fluctuations stabilized within a few weeks.

        dt Ongoing Updates and Regular Monitoring
        dd
          |  Regular updates and monitoring of both domains in Google Search Console were critical to maintain SEO performance and quickly resolve any emerging issues.

        Moving my blog from markhazleton.controlorigins.com to markhazleton.com using Azure Static Web Apps and Cloudflare DNS was a complex but ultimately rewarding process. By following a detailed plan and leveraging the right tools, I was able to maintain SEO performance and provide a seamless experience for my users.

      p.
        The Change of Address tool in Google Search Console helps you migrate your site from one domain to another, such as from example.com to example.org. This tool assists in transferring your Google Search results from the old site to the new one. Use it after implementing 301 redirects and completing any necessary pre-move steps.

      dl
        dt When Not to Use the Change of Address Tool
        dd
          | Avoid using this tool for moves such as HTTP to HTTPS transitions, internal site restructuring, or shifting between www and non-www domains. For these, use redirects and canonical tags instead.

        dt Best Practices for Site Moves
        dd
          | Avoid chaining site moves and combining multiple domains into one move. Maintain the same site architecture to help Google pass ranking signals effectively. Always monitor traffic post-move and maintain redirects for at least 180 days.

        dt Requirements for Using the Tool
        dd
          | You must own both the old and new properties in Search Console, and the tool can only be used for top-level domains, not specific paths. Once initiated, maintain redirects and monitor traffic for changes in Search Console.

        Following these guidelines will help ensure a smooth migration and preserve your site's SEO performance. For further details, always refer to Google's official documentation on the Change of Address tool.
