                    and the rise of more powerful computing capabilities. Algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
                    and Naive Bayes became popular for tasks such as text classification, spam filtering, and sentiment analysis,
                    demonstrating the ability to generalize patterns from data rather than relying on manually crafted rules.
                    Another milestone of the era was the emergence of unsupervised learning methods,
                    such as clustering and topic modeling, which allowed computers to extract insights
                    from unstructured text without explicit human supervision.
                    These advances transformed the way NLP systems were built,
                    making them more adaptable and capable of handling diverse and complex linguistic challenges.
                  p.
                    A major breakthrough during this decade was the introduction of word embeddings,
                    particularly the development of models like Word2Vec by researchers at Google in 2003.
                    Word embeddings represented words as dense, continuous vectors in a high-dimensional space,
                    capturing semantic relationships based on their usage in a corpus.
                    This innovation allowed NLP systems to move beyond simple word matching
                    and incorporate nuanced contextual information,

                  p.
                    The 2010s marked a turning point in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the advent of transformer models,
                    a revolutionary architecture introduced in the 2017 paper “Attention Is All You Need” by Vaswani et al.
                    Transformers redefined NLP by using self-attention mechanisms to process entire sequences of text simultaneously,
                    rather than sequentially, as was the case with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
                    This innovation allowed models to capture long-range dependencies
                    and contextual relationships in language more effectively.
                    Transformers, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
                    and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer),
                    became game-changers for tasks like machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.
                    BERT’s bidirectional approach enabled better comprehension of context by analyzing words in relation
                    to their surrounding text, while GPT demonstrated the power of autoregressive models for text generation.
                    These advancements set new performance benchmarks across a range of NLP tasks.

                  p.
                    The decade also witnessed a surge in pretraining and fine-tuning methodologies,
                    where large transformer models were pretrained on massive datasets
                    and then fine-tuned for specific applications.
                    This approach reduced the need for task-specific datasets and made state-of-the-art NLP accessible to a wider audience.
                    Additionally, frameworks like Hugging Face’s Transformers library simplified the deployment of transformer models,
                    accelerating research and practical implementation. The 2010s were also defined by the democratization of NLP,
                    as open-source models and datasets became widely available, fostering collaboration and innovation.
                    These developments not only pushed the boundaries of what machines could understand
                    and generate but also laid the groundwork for increasingly powerful systems, such as GPT-3
                    and other advanced models in the 2020s. The transformer architecture firmly established itself
                    as the cornerstone of modern NLP, shaping the future of the field.
