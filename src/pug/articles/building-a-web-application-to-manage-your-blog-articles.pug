      h2 Building a Web Application to Manage My Articles
      strong A Journey into Web Content Management Systems
      p.
        Creating and managing a blog has become an essential part of sharing insights, experiences,
        and expertise with the world.
        For those who want to make it easier for writing posts, having a Web Content Management System (CMS)
        to maintain their blog articles just makes sense.
      p.
        This article explores my journey of developing a web application to manage the blog articles on this website.
        The article devles into the process and the parallels with the creation of the Web Project Mechanics (WPM) framework.

        The Quest for Better Web Content Management
      p.
        As I add more articles, I increasingly have a desire to manage the articles in a more efficient and customized manner.
        Trying to keep the navigation, sitemap, and article constancy in sync is a tedious task.
        In the past this has usually let to a journey of building their own CMS.
        So, I embarked on creating a quick application using the tools that I was familiar with.  In this case a Web Application with
        razor pages. I think created a bespoke CMS to suit my unique needs on this blog.  The CMS is a web application that allows me to
        manage the articles on this website and keep the sitemap, navigation, and footer links in sync with my new articles.
      p.
        My goal is to create a user-friendly solution to simplify my article management.

        From Vision to Reality
      p.
        Building the Blog Management Web Application The journey begins by architecting the web application.
        Drawing from previous experiences in web development, I choose to create a web application that employs
        the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for a structured and organized codebase. With the vision set,
        the next step is to define the internal data structure,
        I wanted to keep the JSON file as my persitance layer for storing article information.
      p.
        The heart of the application lies in the ArticleService, responsible for reading, updating, and adding articles.
        Leveraging the power of C# and ASP.NET Core, the service interacts with JSON files, handling article data with ease.
      p.
        The service is more than just a simple data handler; it becomes the orchestrator of article-related actions,
        from CRUD operations to generating sitemap XML and even dynamically creating article templates.

        The Parallels
      p.
        Web Project Mechanics Revisited For those familiar with the Web Project Mechanics (WPM) framework,
        the journey to build a blog management application may seem reminiscent of previous endeavors.
        Just as the WPM framework emerged from the need to streamline project management,
        this CMS venture arises from a passion for efficient content management.
      p.
        Just as WPM offers tools to simplify complex web development tasks,
        the CMS provides tools to streamline article creation, organization, and publication.
        The similarities between these projects highlight the author's affinity for crafting solutions
        that improve workflows and provide tailored experiences.
        Just as the WPM framework brought order to the chaos of web project management,
        this CMS tackles the challenges of blog management, empowering the author to create and share content effortlessly.
        Embracing the Journey As the journey unfolds, the parallels between creating a web application for
        blog management and crafting frameworks like WPM become apparent.
        The allure of transforming ideas into functional tools, refining workflows, and delivering value through technology
        is a driving force that propels developers forward. Just as a master craftsman refines their skills over time,
        each project contributes to the developer's repertoire of expertise.
      p.
        The adventure of building a CMS to manage blog articles is not merely a technical feat; it's a
        testament to the fusion of passion for writing and the art of coding.
        With every line of code, the author is not just creating software but crafting a tool that mirrors
        their values and enhances their capabilities.

      h3 Creating an Interface to Manage Projects
      p.
        I have a JSON file that lists all my projects that I use to showcase various projects,
        managing the project data efficiently would be a bonus.
        Let's walk through the steps to create an interface that allows me to manage project data stored in a `projects.json` file.
        To get going quickly, I will utilize the power of ChatGPT prompts to generate code snippets along the way.
      dl
        dt Requirements
        dd.
          Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
          ul
            li A JSON file named `projects.json` containing your project data.
            li A pug mixin to read the project.json file and display the projects.
        dt Step 1: Define the Project Model
        dd.
            The first step is to create a C# model that represents a project.
            We'll create a `ProjectModel` class to hold project information.
            We can use the ChatGPT prompt to help generate the code for this.
        dt Step 2: Create a Project Service
        dd.
            Next, we need a service to handle the `projects.json` file.
            Let's create a `ProjectService` class.
            We'll use ChatGPT to generate the code for the service.
        dt Step 3: Create a Razor Page for Managing Projects
        dd.
            Now let's create a Razor Page to manage the projects.
            We'll use dependency injection to get the `ProjectService` instance.
            The following code is generated with ChatGPT.

      p.
        And there you have it! You've successfully created an interface to manage projects in your personal blog using ASP.NET Core.
        With the power of ChatGPT prompts, you were able to quickly generate the necessary code snippets
        for the project model, service, and Razor Page. Now you can efficiently manage and showcase your projects on your blog.
      h3.
        Conclusion
      p.
        In the world of web development, the allure of crafting bespoke solutions is undeniable.
        Whether it's building a framework to streamline project management or creating a CMS to manage blog articles,
        the journey is characterized by passion, creativity, and a commitment to improving workflows.  It is a variation
        on the addage "necessity is the mother of invention", in this case the necessity is the desire to create a
        better solution to a problem.
