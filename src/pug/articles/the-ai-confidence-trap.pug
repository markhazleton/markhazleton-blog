            p.mb-3 You know how we've all gotten used to asking ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever AI about pretty much everything? I mean, these things are incredibly good at sounding like they know what they're talking about. But here's something that's been bugging me: I think we might have a problem. These AI systems could be keeping us stuck on what I'm calling the
              strong.text-primary Crest of Hubris
              | ‚Äîand we might not even realize it's happening.

              h3.mb-0.text-info How I Ended Up on This Mountain
            p.mb-3 This whole thing started with some conversations I've been having with colleagues about how AI is changing the way we learn and work. We kept coming back to these psychological patterns that everyone seems to recognize but struggles to articulate.

            p.mb-3 You know the Dunning-Kruger effect, right? That thing where people who know very little are super confident, while actual experts are more humble about what they know. We'd all seen this play out in our careers‚Äîthe junior developer who thinks they can architect the entire system after reading one blog post, or the manager who becomes an "AI expert" after a weekend with ChatGPT.

            p.mb-3 But then someone brought up imposter syndrome, and things got interesting. Here you have the opposite problem‚Äîcompetent people who feel like frauds, constantly worried they'll be "found out" for not knowing enough. We realized we were seeing both phenomena in the same teams, sometimes in the same people at different times.

            p.mb-3 The more we talked about it, the more I started wondering: what happens when you throw AI into this mix? These tools are incredibly good at making you feel knowledgeable. They give you these confident, well-structured responses that can make anyone sound like an expert in casual conversation.

            p.mb-3 I started thinking about my own experience. How many times had I asked an AI about something, gotten a great-sounding answer, and walked away feeling like I "got it"? How often was I actually just fooling myself?

            p.mb-0 That's when I realized we needed a better way to think about this whole journey. The traditional Dunning-Kruger curve didn't quite capture what AI was doing to our learning process. And imposter syndrome felt like it was happening at the wrong times for the wrong reasons.

                  p.mb-0 So I started sketching out this mountain metaphor, trying to reconcile these different patterns I was seeing. What if the learning journey wasn't just about going from ignorant confidence to informed humility? What if AI was creating these new phases‚Äîextended periods of false confidence, deeper crashes, and different kinds of self-doubt?

            p.mt-3.mb-0 The Mountain of Misunderstanding isn't just about the Dunning-Kruger effect. It's about how AI tools are reshaping our entire relationship with knowledge and confidence, creating new peaks and valleys that we need to learn to navigate.

            p.mb-3 Think about it: you ask ChatGPT about climate change, it gives you this comprehensive-sounding response, and you walk away feeling informed. But climate science is incredibly complex, and that AI response was basically just a really good summary of the basics. The problem is, the AI doesn't tell you that, and you don't know to ask.

            p.mb-0 The Mesa of Illusory Mastery is the sneaky one‚Äîit's particularly dangerous because you're just sitting there, thinking you're learning, but you're not actually growing. AI masks your knowledge gaps and delays the humility that's actually necessary for real progress. Think about it: when you ask an AI about quantum computing, it gives you this polished explanation that sounds comprehensive. You walk away feeling like you "get it," but you haven't wrestled with the mathematical foundations, you haven't built intuition through practice, and you haven't hit the walls that force you to really understand the limitations. The AI response feels complete, so you stop digging deeper. Meanwhile, someone who struggled through textbooks, failed at problem sets, and had to rebuild their understanding multiple times has developed genuine expertise. The mesa keeps you comfortable in surface-level knowledge while real mastery requires discomfort, confusion, and the kind of deep engagement that AI can actually prevent.

              | The Trough Trap
            p.mb-0 The Trough of Self-Doubt can trap genuinely capable people in a cycle of learned helplessness that's particularly insidious in our AI-assisted world. I've worked with developers who became so afraid of being wrong that they stopped trusting their own growing expertise, constantly second-guessing decisions they were actually qualified to make. Here's what happens: after that hard fall from the mesa, your confidence crashes deeper than your competence deserves. You start over-relying on external validation‚Äîwhether that's from AI tools, senior colleagues, or online resources‚Äîinstead of developing trust in your own judgment. The irony is that this happens right when you're actually starting to build real skills. You're making progress, but the memory of that earlier overconfidence makes you doubt everything. This creates a weird dependency where you become competent at using tools and resources but lose confidence in your ability to think independently. In software development, I've seen this manifest as developers who can solve complex problems but constantly seek approval for solutions they've already validated. The trough becomes a comfortable place to hide from the responsibility of expertise.

              | Missing the Real Journey
            p.mb-0 The actual learning begins after the fall‚Äîthrough hard work, expert feedback, and honest self-reflection. But if AI keeps you on the mesa too long, you miss years of potential growth and the development of crucial meta-skills that can't be automated. Real expertise isn't just about knowing facts or even understanding concepts; it's about developing judgment, intuition, and the ability to navigate uncertainty. These skills come from making mistakes, recovering from failures, and gradually building confidence through repeated success in challenging situations. When AI extends your time on the mesa, you're not just delaying the inevitable crash‚Äîyou're missing the window where struggle would have built resilience. The people who make it through the traditional learning curve develop something invaluable: the ability to recognize what they don't know, to ask the right questions, and to push through confusion toward genuine understanding. They learn to trust their own thinking while remaining appropriately humble about their limitations. If you spend too long letting AI make you feel smart, you miss the opportunity to become genuinely capable. The mountain isn't just a metaphor for knowledge‚Äîit's a metaphor for the development of wisdom, judgment, and the kind of deep competence that comes from earning your expertise through experience.

                    p Normally, when you think you know something but don't, life corrects you. But with AI, you might never hit that reality check because the response seems so complete and authoritative. Without this feedback, you can't tell if you're actually climbing or just walking in circles on the mesa.

                    p I've noticed this shift where instead of actually solving problems, people just fact-check what the AI told them. That's a completely different mental process, and it's not nearly as good for actually understanding things.

            p.mb-3 The challenge in our AI-assisted world isn't accessing information‚Äîit's developing the wisdom to know where we actually are on the mountain and the discipline to keep climbing even when a computer makes us feel like we've already reached the summit.

            p.mb-3 AI should amplify our thinking, not replace it. When we use it right, it can help us explore ideas we never would have considered and tackle problems more effectively. But when we get lazy and just accept everything it tells us, we risk spending years on that Mesa of Illusory Mastery‚Äîfeeling smart while our actual capabilities stagnate.

It's to use these tools in a way that helps us navigate the mountain more skillfully, with honest awareness of where we are and where we're actually going. That's a very human skill, and it's one we can't afford to lose.
