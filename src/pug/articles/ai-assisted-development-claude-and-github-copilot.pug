      h1 AI-Assisted Development: Claude and GitHub Copilot
      h2.subheading.mb-3 How AI is Transforming Software Development
      p.
        Recent announcments from Anthropic and OpenAI have brought AI-assisted development tools like Claude
        and GitHub Copilot to the forefront of the software development landscape.
        These tools are revolutionizing the way developers write, test, and deploy code,
        offering a glimpse into the future of AI-powered coding environments.
        I wanted to discuss the key themes and information presented in the provided sources regarding
        the use of AI in software development, with a particular focus on Claude (developed by Anthropic)
        and GitHub Copilot (powered by OpenAI), and how the integration of these technologies is transforming
        the software development lifecycle.
