          p.mb-2.
            The explosion of AI Assistants—like OpenAI ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Bard, and others—leverages large language models (LLMs) and careful prompt engineering to develop next-generation applications and interfaces. English is now the language for writing prompts, expanding from documentation to active interaction and instruction.
          p.mb-2.
            Prompt engineering is a rapidly growing field that involves crafting queries and statements in English to effectively 'program' responses from AI systems, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). Just as a programmer uses code to instruct a computer, a prompt engineer uses English to guide the AI in generating desired outcomes.
          p.mb-0.
            Tools like Microsoft’s Azure AI services and the integration of conversational AI within .NET applications illustrate how English is used to direct AI technologies effectively.
