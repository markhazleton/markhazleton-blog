                        Each episode outline should include:
                        1. **Title**: A short, compelling name reflecting the episode's theme or central conflict.
                        2. **Opening Scene**: A vivid description of the crime scene or inciting event that sets the episode in motion.
                        3. **Act I: Investigation Begins**: Detail the initial steps taken by Detectives Briscoe and Green, including key discoveries, witness interviews, and any clues that move the case forward.
                        4. **Act II: The Arrest**: Describe how the detectives narrow down suspects and make the arrest.
                        5. **Act III: The DA's Dilemma**: Show Jack McCoy's strategic approach to building the prosecution's case.
                        6. **Act IV: The Trial**: Outline the courtroom proceedings, focusing on McCoy's compelling arguments.
                        7. **Act V: The Verdict**: Reveal the outcome of the trial and any immediate aftermath.
                        8. **Themes**: Summarize the broader societal or ethical issues explored.
                        9. **Closing Scene**: End with a reflective moment discussing justice and morality.

                      Testing the system involves crafting user prompts derived from real Reddit threads.
                      These prompts simulate inputs and allow iterative improvements. Examples include:

                            Create a detailed episode outline for the *Law & Order* episode titled **"Breach of Trust"**,
                            featuring the classic cast of **Detectives Lennie Briscoe and Ed Green**, and **District Attorney Jack McCoy**.

                            The episode should center on the murder of Victor Hamlin, the CEO of Titan Health, a leading private health insurance company.
                            Detectives discover that Hamlin's murder is linked to Leonard Martone, a former friend of the CEO.
                            The twist is that Hamlin froze the insurance coverage for Martone's daughter's life-saving treatment,
                            employing the classic "Delay, Defer, and Depose" strategy to maximize company profits.

                            This betrayal destroyed their friendship and led to Martone's desperation and ultimate confrontation.
                            The episode should delve into themes of corporate corruption, personal betrayal,
                            and the human cost of profit-driven decisions, all within the classic *Law & Order* tone.
