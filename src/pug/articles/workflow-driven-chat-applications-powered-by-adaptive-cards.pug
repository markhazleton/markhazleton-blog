          p.
            Chat applications with artificial intelligence (AI) are leading us into an era of intelligent interaction,
            revolutionizing the way we communicate. This potential allows developers to build chat systems with
            intelligent, context-aware interactions, moving beyond the rigid limitations of traditional decision trees.
            However, leveraging this technology effectively requires aligning it with clear business goals to ensure it
            delivers tangible results.
      p.
        One way to achieve this balance is through Adaptive Cards and workflow-driven processes.
        Adaptive Cards are versatile UI components that enable developers to craft visually appealing, interactive
        content optimized for chat applications. Paired with workflows, these cards provide the necessary structure
        for guiding users through pre-defined steps, fostering coherent interactions that achieve the desired outcomes.
      p.
        By integrating workflows with Adaptive Cards, developers can create structured, goal-oriented chat
        applications that maintain the flexibility and innovation of AI-driven interactions while ensuring alignment
        with business objectives.
        Workflows provide the structure necessary for chat-driven interactions to be coherent,
        allowing developers to guide users through a series of pre-defined steps that lead to a desired outcome.
      p.
        An established, deterministic tool is critical in this context and cannot be overstated.
        It follows established processes and reduces variability in areas like healthcare where variability can be dangerous.
        There is a neeed for the application to respond correctly and without delay and to be accurate in its responses.
        It also might be a framework within which to embed an AI algorithm,
        though not necessarily a deep-learning one trained on a large set of human-produced "right" answers to "wrong"-answer questions.
      p.
        The chat applications of the future will be built around the workflows that drive them.
        We have an opportunity to build something that is fundamentally more interactive and functional,
        and therefore more useful, than what we currently have; something that is fundamentally more "intelligent," in the colloquial sense,
        because it incorporates modern chat experiences as just one part of a "smarter" user experience.
      p.
        Integrating AI-based chat applications into structured processes lets organizations work more efficiently.
        The workflows themselves haven't really changed; they were always stepwise and needed a fair amount of cognitive effort to carry out.
        But now, chat application can improve the tedious, routine tasks that are necessary precursors to more engaging and higher-level work.
        If chat applications can take over these necessary but uninteresting jobs,
        then they may actually be increasing productivity in a work environment
        that many think of as having too many drags on its engagement quotient.
      p.
        The winning chat applications will be the ones that can achieve two seemingly contradictory tasks:
        bringing the user to the system's goal while concurrently enriching the user's experience.
        They represent the highest level of artificial intelligence in the direction of chatbots so farâ€”a dual
        achievement of understanding the user's intent and understanding the system's intent.
        The next generation of smart chat applications should engage intuitively with the user for the user's good and get the user
        to do the things that the system wants the user to do, without the user feeling like they're being 'handled.'

          p.
            AI excels in processing and generating language, but without a clear structure, conversations can lose focus and frustrate users. Workflow-driven design, supported by Adaptive Cards, provides the framework needed to:
          ul
            li Ensure goal-oriented interactions.
            li Prevent inefficient, meandering conversations.
            li Align user interactions with predefined workflows and objectives.

          p.
            Imagine a chat application designed to guide users through the process of brewing the perfect cup of coffee.
            The workflow begins with a welcome message and progresses based on user preferences for coffee strength
            and brewing method. The workflow adapts to inputs, offering tailored guidance for drip coffee,
            pour-over, or French press methods.
          p At each stage, users can:
          ul
            li Receive actionable tips for enhancing their coffee experience.
            li Choose to start over or end the interaction.

          h4 How the Workflow Enhances the Experience
          p.

              {
              "id": "chooseStrength",
              "question": "How strong would you like your coffee?",
              "answers": [
                { "response": "Mild", "nextNode": "chooseBrewMethod" },
                { "response": "Medium", "nextNode": "chooseBrewMethod" },
                { "response": "Strong", "nextNode": "chooseBrewMethod" }
              ]
              }
          p Each node in the workflow includes:

          ul
            li <strong>A question</strong> that frames the interaction.
            li <strong>Answers</strong> that direct the user to the next step in the workflow.
