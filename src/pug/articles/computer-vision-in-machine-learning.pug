      h2 Training a Model to Recognize Dogs and Cats
      p.
        Training a computer vision model to classify images of dogs and cats involves several steps. In this section, we’ll walk you through preparing your dataset, building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), training the model, and evaluating its performance using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

      h3 Step 1: Prepare the Dataset
      p.
        Start by downloading a labeled dataset of dog and cat images, such as the popular
        Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data .
        Organize the images into two folders:
      ul
        li "dogs/"
        li "cats/"
      p.
        Ensure the images are split into training, validation, and testing sets to prevent overfitting and enable proper evaluation:
      pre.language-python
        code.language-python.
          import os
          import shutil
          from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

          # Define paths
          dataset_dir = "path/to/dataset"
          train_dir = "path/to/train"
          val_dir = "path/to/val"
          test_dir = "path/to/test"

          # Split data
          def split_data(source, train, val, test, split_ratio=(0.7, 0.2, 0.1)):
            files = os.listdir(source)
            train_files, val_test_files = train_test_split(files, test_size=(split_ratio[1] + split_ratio[2]))
            val_files, test_files = train_test_split(val_test_files, test_size=split_ratio[2] / (split_ratio[1] + split_ratio[2]))

          # Move files to appropriate folders
            for f in train_files:
              shutil.move(os.path.join(source, f), os.path.join(train, f))
            for f in val_files:
              shutil.move(os.path.join(source, f), os.path.join(val, f))
            for f in test_files:
              shutil.move(os.path.join(source, f), os.path.join(test, f))
      p.
        Organize your files into folders named `dogs/` and `cats/` within each dataset split.
      h3 Step 2: Build a CNN Model
      p.
        Use TensorFlow/Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks:
      pre.language-python
        code.language-python.
          import tensorflow as tf
          from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
          from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

          # Build the CNN
          model = Sequential([
            Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)),
            MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
            Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
            MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
            Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
            MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
            Flatten(),
            Dense(512, activation='relu'),

      h3 Step 4: Visualize Model Performance and Results
      p.
        After training your model, it is essential to evaluate its performance and visualize the results. This helps you understand how well the model is learning and identify areas for improvement.

      h4 Visualizing Training and Validation Accuracy and Loss
      p.
        During training, Keras tracks metrics like accuracy and loss for both the training and validation datasets. You can visualize these metrics using Matplotlib to identify trends such as overfitting or underfitting.
      pre.language-python
        code.language-python.
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

          # Assume history is the output of model.fit()
          acc = history.history['accuracy']
          val_acc = history.history['val_accuracy']
          loss = history.history['loss']
          val_loss = history.history['val_loss']

          epochs = range(1, len(acc) + 1)

          # Plot training and validation accuracy
          plt.figure()
          plt.plot(epochs, acc, label='Training Accuracy')
          plt.plot(epochs, val_acc, label='Validation Accuracy')
          plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy')
          plt.legend()

          # Plot training and validation loss
          plt.figure()
          plt.plot(epochs, loss, label='Training Loss')
          plt.plot(epochs, val_loss, label='Validation Loss')
          plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')
          plt.legend()

          plt.show()

      p.
        Look for patterns in the graphs:
      ul
        li A large gap between training and validation accuracy indicates overfitting.
        li A flat training accuracy line suggests underfitting or insufficient model complexity.

      h4 Evaluating Model Performance on the Test Set
      p.
        Evaluate the model on unseen test data to measure its real-world performance:
      pre.language-python
        code.language-python.
          # Evaluate on test data
          test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_generator)
          print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}")
          print(f"Test Loss: {test_loss:.2f}")

      h4 Visualizing Predictions
      p.
        You can visualize the model's predictions on test images to assess how it performs qualitatively.
      pre.language-python
        code.language-python.
          import numpy as np

          # Load and preprocess a test image
          img_path = 'path_to_test_image.jpg'
          img = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(150, 150))
          img_array = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
          img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

          # Predict the class
          prediction = model.predict(img_array)
          class_label = 'Dog' if prediction[0] > 0.5 else 'Cat'

          # Display the image with the predicted label
          plt.imshow(tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img(img_path))
          plt.title(f"Predicted: {class_label}")
          plt.axis('off')
          plt.show()

      p.
        By analyzing individual predictions, you can identify cases where the model struggles and refine the dataset or model architecture as needed.

      h4 Advanced Visualization Techniques
      p.
        For deeper insights, consider using visualization tools like Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to highlight which parts of the image influenced the model's predictions. This technique is especially useful for debugging complex models.
      pre.language-python
        code.language-python.
          import cv2
          import numpy as np

          # Grad-CAM visualization
          def grad_cam(model, img_array, last_conv_layer_name):
            grad_model = tf.keras.models.Model(
              [model.inputs], [model.get_layer(last_conv_layer_name).output, model.output]
            )
            with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
              conv_outputs, predictions = grad_model(img_array)
              loss = predictions[:, 0]
            grads = tape.gradient(loss, conv_outputs)
            pooled_grads = tf.reduce_mean(grads, axis=(0, 1, 2))
            conv_outputs = conv_outputs[0]
            heatmap = tf.reduce_sum(pooled_grads * conv_outputs, axis=-1)
            heatmap = np.maximum(heatmap, 0) / np.max(heatmap)

            return heatmap

          # Generate and display Grad-CAM heatmap
          heatmap = grad_cam(model, img_array, 'last_conv_layer_name')
          plt.imshow(heatmap, cmap='viridis')
          plt.title('Grad-CAM Heatmap')
          plt.axis('off')
          plt.show()

      p.
        Grad-CAM heatmaps provide a clear view of what the model is focusing on in an image, helping to diagnose errors and improve trust in the model.
