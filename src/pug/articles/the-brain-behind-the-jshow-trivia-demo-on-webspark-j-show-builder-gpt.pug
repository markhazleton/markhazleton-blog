          In this article, I’ll walk you through how J-Show Builder GPT was developed and how it powers the JShow Trivia Demo on WebSpark.

        dl
          dt The Genesis of J-Show Builder GPT
          dd
            | The idea for J-Show Builder GPT was born from a desire to create complex trivia games with minimal user input,
            | making it accessible to everyone—from casual trivia enthusiasts to educators looking to create interactive learning experiences.
            | To bring this vision to life, I needed a solution that could:
            ul
              li Understand Themes: Interpret any given theme and break it down into relevant subtopics and categories.
              li Generate Content: Create well-structured questions and answers for different difficulty levels, adhering to a structured grid format.
              li Format Output: Produce the output in a JSON structure that can be easily integrated into WebSpark's JShow Trivia Demo application.

          dt Building J-Show Builder GPT
          dd
            | Creating J-Show Builder GPT involved several key steps:
            dl
              dt Choosing the AI Model
              dd.
                J-Show Builder GPT is based on OpenAI's GPT-4, chosen for its proficiency in natural language understanding and generation.
              dt Defining the JSON Structure
              dd.
                i.bi.bi-filetype-json.me-2.text-success // Icon for JSON
                | I designed a JSON schema that included fields for the theme and description,
                and three rounds of questions: 'Round 1', 'Round 2', and 'Final Round'. Each round has multiple categories,
                with each category containing five questions of increasing difficulty.  The final round has only one question.
                The JSON structure also includes the questions for each answer.

              dt Customizing the GPT
              dd.
                i.bi.bi-gear.me-2.text-secondary // Icon for customization
                | Using prompt engineering, the GPT was customized to generate content specifically for JShows,
                including examples and instructions for structure.  When complete, the GPT was fine-tuned to ensure high-quality output.
                I was able to publish the GPT on ChatGPT for public access.

          dt Adding JSON Files to the Soltuion
          dd
            | Onece the JSON file is created, I added it to the JShow Trivia Demo on WebSpark to enable users to play the trivia game.
            | For now, the JSON file is static and located in a folder on the server.
            | In the future, I plan to add a feature that will allow users to create their own JSON files
            | or just call the Open AI API directly from the JShow Trivia Demo admin page.

          dt How J-Show Builder GPT Powers the JShow Trivia Demo
          dd
            i.bi.bi-lightning-charge.me-2.text-warning // Icon for power/impact
            | The JShow Trivia Demo on WebSpark showcases the full capabilities of J-Show Builder GPT:
            dl
              dt User Input
              dd Users enter a theme, such as "Microsoft .NET" or "Classic Movies".
              dt AI Processing
              dd J-Show Builder GPT processes the input, creating categories and questions.
              dt JSON Output
              dd The quiz is formatted into a JSON structure compatible with the JShow Trivia Demo.
            p.
              For now the J-Show game does not track scores or have user profiles, this may be added int the future.  I am looking at a streamlined way
              to add interactive game maintenance features to the JShow Trivia Demo.


          dt Impact and Future of J-Show Builder GPT
          dd
            | J-Show Builder GPT has transformed the way trivia content is generated on WebSpark.
            | With the ability to create high-quality, theme-based quiz shows it has opened up new possibilities for interactive learning and entertainment.
            | Moving forward, I plan to enhance its capabilities further by adding support for multimedia elements,
            | expanding question types, and integrating real-time feedback.
            ul
              li Future Support for multimedia elements like images and audio
              li Future variety of question types (e.g., multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank)
              li Future Real-time user feedback based on quiz performance

        h3 Conclusion
        p.
