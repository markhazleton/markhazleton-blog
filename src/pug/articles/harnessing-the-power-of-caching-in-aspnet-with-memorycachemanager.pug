      .subheading Harnessing the Power of Caching in ASP.NET with MemoryCacheManager
      p.lead
        | While working on the AsyncDemo project, I encountered a practical challenge: managing the request limits of the OpenWeather API. As most developers know, API request limits can be a tricky aspect, especially when working with limited resources. In search of a straightforward solution that wouldn't rely heavily on third-party libraries, I developed the MemoryCacheManager class. It's a no-fuss, efficient way to cache API calls – a simple yet effective tool that aligns well with the needs of a project like AsyncDemo. This article is a walk-through of how MemoryCacheManager fits into the picture, offering a modest peek into the world of caching in ASP.NET development.

        dd By caching frequently accessed data, MemoryCacheManager enhances application performance through reduced data retrieval operations. It aids in scalability and ensures consistent data access in multi-threaded environments, common in modern web applications.
      h2 Code Walkthrough of MemoryCacheManager
      p The MemoryCacheManager class is a finely-tuned component designed to enhance the performance of ASP.NET applications through efficient caching. Let's take a closer look at its core parts:
      h3 Initialization and Setup
      p
        | The class initializes a static
        code ConcurrentDictionary
        | ,
        code _allKeys
        | , to keep track of cache keys. This ensures thread safety and efficient management of cache keys. Additionally, an instance of
        code IMemoryCache
        | , provided by ASP.NET Core, is used for actual caching operations.
      h3 Cache Operations
      ul
        li
          strong Adding to Cache:
          | The
          code Set
          |  method adds items to the cache. It handles key management and sets cache options, including expiration.
        li
          strong Retrieving from Cache:
          | The
          code Get
          |  method fetches items, leveraging the cache-first strategy. If an item is not in cache, it’s loaded and then stored in cache for subsequent requests.
        li
          strong Removing from Cache:
          | The
          code Remove
          |  method removes items from the cache and updates the key dictionary accordingly.
      h3 Eviction Policy
      p
        | The class implements an eviction policy through the
        code PostEviction
        |  callback. This method gets triggered when items are evicted from the cache, allowing for custom actions based on the eviction reason.
      h3 Cache Clearing and Disposal
      ul
        li
          strong Clearing the Cache:
          | The
          code Clear
          |  method iterates through all keys and removes each item from the cache, ensuring a clean state.
        li
          strong Disposal Pattern:
          | While the current implementation of
          code Dispose
          |  method is empty, it provides a structure for resource cleanup if needed in the future.
      h3 Concurrency and Lock Management
      p
        | A unique feature is the
        code PerformActionWithLock
        |  method, which ensures that actions are performed with exclusive access, preventing race conditions in multi-threaded scenarios.
      p
        | This walkthrough provides a high-level understanding of the MemoryCacheManager class, emphasizing its role in efficient caching and application performance enhancement. To delve into the specifics, visit the demonstration code on GitHub.

      h3 CancellationTokenSource in MemoryCacheManager
      p
        | There is an instance of the
        code CancellationTokenSource
        a(href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtokensource') https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtokensource
        | within the MemoryCacheManager class which plays a role in managing the lifecycle of cache entries.
        | Let's delve into its purpose and functionality:
      dl
        dt Purpose of CancellationTokenSource
        dd
          | The
          code CancellationTokenSource
          |  is a powerful .NET construct used to signal cancellation in asynchronous and potentially long-running operations. In the context of the MemoryCacheManager, it serves to manage the expiration and clearing of cache entries.
        dt Managing Cache Lifespan
        dd
          | When a cache entry is added using the
          code Set
          |  method, the
          code CancellationTokenSource
          |  is tied to the cache entry's options. This integration allows for controlled expiration of cache items based on specific conditions or time frames.
        dt Controlled Cache Invalidation
        dd
          | In scenarios where there's a need to invalidate the cache prematurely, the
          code CancellationTokenSource
        dt Recreating the Token After Clearing
        dd
          | Upon invoking the
          |  can be used to cancel all associated cache entries. This mechanism is especially useful for implementing dynamic cache clearing strategies, where cache consistency is critical.
          code Clear
          |  method, the
          code CancellationTokenSource
          |  is canceled and disposed of, effectively clearing the cache. It’s then crucial to recreate the
          code CancellationTokenSource
          |  to ensure that new cache entries can be added with their cancellation tokens, maintaining the integrity of cache management.
      p
        | Overall, the
        |  in MemoryCacheManager adds a layer of flexibility and control over how cache entries are managed, ensuring that they can be invalidated as per application requirements, contributing to both the efficiency and reliability of caching mechanisms.

      h2 Best Practices and Considerations
      dl
        dt Cache Invalidation Strategy:
        dd Implement an effective strategy for cache invalidation to maintain data consistency.
        dt Memory Management:
        dd Monitor memory usage to prevent potential leaks and optimize performance.
        dt Testing and Optimization:
        dd Regularly test and adjust the cache configuration to meet the specific needs of your application.
      h2 Conclusion
      p The MemoryCacheManager class is an essential tool for ASP.NET developers aiming to enhance their application's performance. It offers a balance between simplicity and functionality, making it ideal for robust memory management in web applications.
