    h1.mb-0 Mark Hazleton - not sidetracked by sizzle
    h2.mb-3 Solutions Architect, lifelong learner
    p.mb-2.
      As a Solutions Architect and lifelong learner, I create solutions that make technology
      work for businesses. With a focus on tangible benefits, I avoid
      getting <a href='/sidetrackedbysizzle.html' target='_self' title='Sidetracked by Sizzle Explained'> sidetracked
      by sizzle that does not deliver</a>.
      The goals of the business are the primary driver for a solution to be successful.
      I have extensive experience developing solutions for both on-premises and cloud-based providers.
      From small business-to-consumer websites to large enterprise projects, I have worked with organizations of all sizes
      to deliver successful solutions.

        With a career dedicated to bridging technology with business goals,
        these articles embody a commitment to cutting through the noise and focusing on the essentials.
        Drawing from my experiences,  I try to write from a pragmatic perspective where substance
        reigns supreme and tangible outcomes matter most.
