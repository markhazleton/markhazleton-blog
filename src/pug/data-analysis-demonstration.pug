      p.lead.
        The Data Analysis Demonstration, written by Mark Hazleton in the early 2010s,
        is a powerful tool that showcases how .Net tools
        can be used to analyze data in the Comma Separated Variable (CSV) file format.
        While many software applications may become outdated over time, the Data Analysis Demo
        continues to be a relevant demonstration of data visualization in .Net web applications.
      p.
        Data analysis and visualization are critical components of any business or research project.
        Understanding complex data sets can be a daunting task, but visualizing the data can make it
        easier to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. The Data Analysis Demonstration is a
        web application that simplifies the process of data visualization and analysis by providing users
        with powerful charting and pivoting functionality.

            Users can select from a list of CSV files and analyze them in depth.
            The application provides an analysis of how many columns with basic attributes such as Min Value, Max Value,
            Unique Values, Most Common Value, Least Common Value, number of rows, and index position for each column.

            Once a CSV file is selected, users can explore the data by creating custom charts and pivot tables.
            With the ability to save chart configurations, users can easily reproduce their work or share their findings with others.

        dt Pivoting Functionality

          p.
            In addition to charting, the Data Analysis Demo leverages PivotTable.js, an open-source JavaScript library
            that enables users to explore and analyze data by turning a data set into a summary table. With drag-and-drop
            functionality, PivotTable.js makes it easy to manipulate the summary table, turning it into a pivot table or
            pivot chart that provides valuable insights into the data.

            summary table, turning it into a pivot table or pivot chart that provides valuable insights into the data.
            PivotTable.js' basic function is to enable data exploration and analysis by turning a data set into a
            summary table and then optionally adding a true 2-d drag-drop UI to allow a user to manipulate this
            summary table, turning it into a pivot table, very similar to the one found in older versions of
            Microsoft Excel with a bunch of extra developer-oriented features and some visualization effects.
            With optional add-ons, the summary table can be rendered as various kinds of charts, turning the
            pivot table into a pivot chart.

            The Data Analysis Demo's charting functionality uses the System.Web.UI.DataVisualization.Charting
            library from Microsoft.
            This customizable library provides a wide range of chart types, including line charts,
            bar charts, pie charts, and more.
            Users can save their chart configurations for future use, making it easy to reproduce their work or share their findings with others.

            The Data Analysis Demonstration's powerful charting and pivoting functionality make it an ideal
            tool for anyone who needs to analyze and visualize data. Whether you're a business analyst,
            researcher, or developer, the application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring data
            and extracting valuable insights. With its customizable charting library and intuitive pivot table
            functionality, the Data Analysis Demonstration is a must-have tool for anyone who works with data.

            This is an old demonstration that has been updated to run on Microsoft Asp.Net Framework 4.8.   While the
            application is old, it is still a relevant demonstration of data visualization in .Net web applications.
            It is nice to see that the application has aged well and continues to be a useful tool for data analysis.
