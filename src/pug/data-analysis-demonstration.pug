                | The Data Analysis Demonstration, written by Mark Hazleton in the early 2010s, is a powerful tool that showcases how .NET tools can be used to analyze data in the Comma Separated Variable (CSV) file format. While many software applications may become outdated over time, the Data Analysis Demo continues to be a relevant demonstration of data visualization in .NET web applications.

                | Data analysis and visualization are critical components of any business or research project. Understanding complex data sets can be a daunting task, but visualizing the data can make it easier to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. The Data Analysis Demonstration is a web application that simplifies the process of data visualization and analysis by providing users with powerful charting and pivoting functionality.

                | In addition to charting, the Data Analysis Demo leverages PivotTable.js, an open-source JavaScript library that enables users to explore and analyze data by turning a data set into a summary table. With drag-and-drop functionality, PivotTable.js makes it easy to manipulate the summary table, turning it into a pivot table or pivot chart that provides valuable insights into the data.

              p.mb-0
                | PivotTable.js' basic function is to enable data exploration and analysis by turning a data set into a summary table and then optionally adding a true 2-d drag-drop UI to allow a user to manipulate this summary table, turning it into a pivot table, very similar to the one found in older versions of Microsoft Excel with a bunch of extra developer-oriented features and some visualization effects. With optional add-ons, the summary table can be rendered as various kinds of charts, turning the pivot table into a pivot chart.

                | The Data Analysis Demo's charting functionality uses the System.Web.UI.DataVisualization.Charting library from Microsoft. This customizable library provides a wide range of chart types, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and more. Users can save their chart configurations for future use, making it easy to reproduce their work or share their findings with others.
